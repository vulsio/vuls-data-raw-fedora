At that time this bug will be closed as\nEOL if it remains open with a Fedora 'version' of '28'.\n\nPackage Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you\nplan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version' \nto a later Fedora version.\n\nThank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not \nable to fix it before Fedora 28 is end of life. If you would still like \nto see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version \nof Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora \nversion prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.\n\nAlthough we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's \nlifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a \nmore recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes \nbugs or makes them obsolete."
