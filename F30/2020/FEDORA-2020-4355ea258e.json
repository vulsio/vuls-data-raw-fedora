For chromium, that means it needs to build successfully on x86_64, i686, and aarch64 (this is the slow one). \n \n> > (This is also why I have resisted efforts to enable armv7hl support, because\n> > I believe that will almost double the time necessary for chromium builds to\n> > finish).\n> \n> What about running all builds for all architectures in parallel?

This means either leaving users with an insecure system (which is not acceptable), or pushing an update that uninstalls Chromium (probably not acceptable either).\n* Make an exception to Fedora policy to allow Chromium to be cross-compiled.  Chromium should support this."
