No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against 2-prime RSA1024, 3-prime RSA1536, and DSA1024 as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH512 are considered just feasible. However, for an attack the target would have to re-use the DH512 private key, which is not recommended anyway. Also applications directly using the low level API BN_mod_exp may be affected if they use BN_FLG_CONSTTIME.\n\nOpenSSL versions 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 are affected by this issue. However due to the low severity of this issue we are not creating new releases at this time. The 1.1.1 mitigation for this issue can be found in commit 419102400. The 1.0.2 mitigation for this issue can be found in commit f1c5eea8a."

When the peer sends a value which is not in the list, the lookup returns NULL, but we unconditionally dereference the lookup result for the comparison, leading to an application crash triggerable by an unauthenticated client.\n\nSince we will not be able to say anything about algorithms we don't recognize, the patch treats NULL return from lookup as \"does not match\".\n\nOnly TLS 1.3 is affected in the code, since only \"signature_algorithm_cert\" is supported for TLS 1.3"

Thus, applications that use openssl without invoking the `SSL_check_chain()` function are not vulnerable to this flaw.\n\nLastly, no Red Hat Middleware products ship the affected version of OpenSSL. However, some components, such as Netty and Wildfly, may be configured by customers to use any OpenSSL version. Customers who have configured their setups to use a vulnerable version of OpenSSL are advised to upgrade to the latest unaffected version immediately."
