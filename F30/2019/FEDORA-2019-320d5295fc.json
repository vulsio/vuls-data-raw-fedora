For example when invalid urls are passed to both the functions they would return -1 to their calling functions. However callers dont check for this error and continue processing as if no error was received and the URL was valid. This could cause a security bypass ie invalid/malicious URLs considered valid and processed. \n\nAn application which uses the above API, and allows attackers to load arbitrary URLs would be vulnerable.
