No upstream python version is affected by this regression but the vulnerable commit may already have been included downstream as part of the original fix for CVE-2019-9636.\n\nAffected python versions ignore the user/password part before `@` in the netloc component of a URL, thus it still allows an attacker to exploit the vulnerability as in CVE-2019-9636. Those functions do not properly handle URLs encoded with Punycode/Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications (IDNA), which may result in a wrong domain name (specifically the netloc component of URL - user@domain:port) being returned by those functions. When an application parses user-supplied URLs to store cookies, authentication credentials, or other kind of information, it is possible for an attacker to provide specially crafted URLs to make the application locate host-related information (e.g. cookies, authentication data) and send them to a different host than where it should, unlike if the URLs had been correctly parsed. The result of an attack may vary based on the application.\n\nExternal Reference\nhttps://python-security.readthedocs.io/vuln/urlsplit-nfkc-normalization2.html\n\nVulnerable commit\nhttps://github.com/python/cpython/commit/d537ab0ff9767ef024f26246899728f0116b1ec3\n\nUpstream patch\nhttps://github.com/python/cpython/commit/8d0ef0b5edeae52960c7ed05ae8a12388324f87e"
