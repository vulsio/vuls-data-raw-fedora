It does not checks what the process actually does. Therefore the fact that kill returns 0 is expected and not a bug.\n\n--- Additional comment from Ramesh Sahoo on 2017-09-13 18:50:42 CEST ---\n\n\nIf someone executing reload command it must return something i.e. either success or error. If kill -HUL can't fulfill this then we shouldn't use this at all and if we use this my suggestion to replace the below parameter in reload which definitely returns something. \n\nnamed-checkconf > /dev/null 2>&1 && { rndc reload > /dev/null 2>&1 || /bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID; } || exit 1\n\n--- Additional comment from Petr Menšík on 2017-09-15 12:19:16 CEST ---\n\nHi Ramesh.\n\nCurrent state is a bit unfortunate. rndc reload command returns error when configuration error is found. Rdnc configuration is enabled by default, but kill is used in case rndc cannot connect to the server. It cannot tell difference between reload failed because there is configuration error and failed to connect to the server at all. If you are sure rndc works and if not, it is an error, you can remove \" || /bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID\" from ExecReload.\n\nExtension of systemd service file can be used for this.\nCreate file /etc/systemd/system/named.service.d/reload.conf with contents:\n\n; Simply rely on rndc to be properly configured to communicate with local server\n[Service]\nExecReload=\nExecReload=/usr/sbin/rndc reload\n\nIf used like that, any error in reload would be reported by systemctl. Some users may not want to use rndc at all.\nOr use named-checkconf the same way like on start. If named-checkconf fails, no reload command or signal would be sent.\n\n; More compatible solution\n[Service]\nExecReload=\nExecReload=/bin/bash -c 'if [ ! \"$DISABLE_ZONE_CHECKING\" == \"yes\" ]; then /usr/sbin/named-checkconf -z /etc/named.conf; else echo \"Checking of zone files is disabled\"; fi'\nExecReload=/bin/sh -c '/usr/sbin/rndc reload > /dev/null 2>&1 || /bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID'\n\nrun \"systemctl daemon-reload\" to load extension into running systemd.\n\nSome runtime errors are not catched by named-checkconf however. It would be nice if rndc reload could return different code for failed operation reported by the server and failed connection to the server. It would be able use kill -HUP only when connection to the server failed, not when server already indicated error on reload. No such feature exist even in lastest development releases however.\n\n--- Additional comment from Petr Menšík on 2019-07-30 11:34:48 CEST ---\n\nrndc null can be used to verify connection to named without doing anything actually. Makes possible to distinguish whether connection to named failed in case of disabled control channel in configuration.\n\n; Compatible solution reporting errors on rndc reload failure\n[Service]\nExecReload=\nExecReload=/bin/bash -c 'if [ ! \"$DISABLE_ZONE_CHECKING\" == \"yes\" ]; then /usr/sbin/named-checkconf -z /etc/named.conf; else echo \"Checking of zone files is disabled\"; fi'\nExecReload=/bin/sh -c 'if /usr/sbin/rndc null > /dev/null 2>&1 ; then /usr/sbin/rndc reload; else /bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID; fi'\n\nThis way, rndc null errors are ignored and kill is used instead. If null succeed, reload is requested. Failures in that are reported.\n\n--- Additional comment from Petr Menšík on 2019-08-08 11:22:59 CEST ---\n\nOh, proposed solution with if would not work, because of systemd bug [1]. It makes reload terminate the service, which is not desired at all. Return code has to be ignored until this is fixed. It makes impossible to report failure in reload in different way than just log message. RHEL 8 bug #1735787 fixed it.\n\nUntil that is fixed, it may just log error into log file:\n# /etc/systemd/system/named.service.d/reload.conf\n; vim:set ft=systemd:\n[Service]\nExecReload=\nExecReload=-/bin/sh -c 'if /usr/sbin/rndc null > /dev/null 2>&1; then /usr/sbin/rndc reload || true; else /bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID; fi'\n\n\n1. https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/13098"

If you would still like \nto see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version \nof Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora \nversion prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.\n\nAlthough we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's \nlifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a \nmore recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes \nbugs or makes them obsolete."

The update to this functionality introduced by CVE-2018-5743 changed how BIND calculates the number of concurrent TCP clients from counting the outstanding TCP queries to counting the TCP client connections. On a server with TCP-pipelining capability, it is possible for one TCP client to send a large number of DNS requests over a single connection. Each outstanding query will be handled internally as an independent client request, thus bypassing the new TCP clients limit."

The impact is confined to any clients that are behaving as noted above; service is not degraded on the server for other clients. The malfunction can manifest itself in one of two ways:\n\na) Some client queries are dropped (server sees them as malformed) b) The TCP connection appears to hang\n\nA hanging TCP connection will clear when either the client or the server initiates a close or reset.\n\nWe think that it is unlikely that there are any genuine TCP clients sending high volumes of TCP-pipelined queries; problems reported to ISC have been due solely to malfunctioning clients.  Also the majority of DNS client query traffic today is still transported over UDP."

However this functionality was not correctly implemented, a attacker could use a single TCP connection to send large number of DNS requests causing denial of service. As per upstream the fix does not help in a situation where a TCP-pipelining client is sending queries at an excessive rate, allowing a backlog of outstanding queries to build up. More details about this is available in the upstream advisory.\n\nThis bind flaw can be exploited by a remote attacker (AV:N) by opening large number of  simultaneous TCP client connections with the server. The attacker needs to use a server which has TCP-pipelining capability to use one TCP connection to send large number of requests. (AC:L and PR:N) No user interaction is required from the server side (UI:N). The attacker can cause denial of service (A:H) by exhausting the file descriptor pool which named has access to. (S:U)"

The server restart is necessary because neither a 'reload' nor a 'reconfig' operation will properly reset currently pipelining TCP clients.\nDisabling TCP-pipelining entirely is completely effective at mitigating the vulnerability with minimal impact to clients that use pipelined TCP connections and with no impact to clients that do not support TCP-pipelining. The majority of Internet client DNS queries are transported over UDP or TCP without use of TCP-pipelining.\nNote: This mitigation will only work with bind-9.11 and above."
