The arguments to `sd_bus_add_object_vtable()` are all constant statics, so this is unlikely to be due to a change in `dbus-broker`. I went ahead and checked systemd changes. There was a recent systemd-242 release, handful of days ago, which happened to be pushed into rawhide at the same time as `dbus-broker-20`.\n\nThe new systemd-242 release brings API changes to the sd-bus VTABLE logic. But before I dive into this, can you answer me some questions?\n\n - Are you running rawhide or F30?\n - Did you skip updates to any other package than `dbus-broker`? That is, did you happen to postpone the systemd-242 update?\n - What architecture do you run this on?\n\nI will discuss the vtable changes with systemd people later today. I suspect they forgot to bump some symbol-versions. Regardless, I am quite confident this is a different issue than the original bug in this issue.\n\nThanks!\nDavid"

I reported this and discussed it last week with the systemd developers. There is a pending fix on github and this will be pushed into Fedora. Until then, Zbigniew might just revert the breaking changes in rawhide, but I am not sure about this.\n\nFor details, see: https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/12351\n\nAs a summary: systemd-242 updates `libsystemd`, but unintentionally breaks symbol-versioning and auto-detection of dependencies in `rpm`. This is quite non-obvious, but packages compiled against systemd-242 (which happens to be the current rawhide version) will not run properly against any older systemd version."
