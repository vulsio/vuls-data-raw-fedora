The checks are done by first parsing the URL with apr_uri_parse() and then by looking at the parsed values. However, some URLs may be incorrectly parsed by apr_uri_parse() and still be correctly used by browsers.\n\nA remote attacker may use this flaw to trick a victim user into visiting a trusted vulnerable web site which, when handling a specially crafted URL, would redirect the victim to another malicious URL, possibly performing other kinds of attacks."

The httpd server indeed crashes, but the parent httpd process does not and it just spawns new httpd children processes. I would say you could have a Denial of Service if you keep crashing the server very quickly, but I believe it is still Low impact."
