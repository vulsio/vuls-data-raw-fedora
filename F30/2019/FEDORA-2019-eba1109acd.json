When used to operate an access point with SAE (SimultaneousAuthentication of Equals; also known as WPA3-Personal), an invalid authentication sequence could result in the hostapd process terminating due to a NULL pointer dereference when processing SAE confirm message. This was caused by missing state validation steps when processing the SAE confirm message in hostapd/AP mode. An attacker in radio range of an access point using hostapd in SAE configuration could use this issue to perform a denial of service attack by forcing the hostapd process to terminate.\n\n\nReferences:\nhttps://w1.fi/security/2019-3/sae-confirm-missing-state-validation.txt\nhttps://wpa3.mathyvanhoef.com/\n\nUpstream Patch:\nhttps://w1.fi/cgit/hostap/commit/?id=ac8fa9ef198640086cf2ce7c94673be2b6a018a0"
