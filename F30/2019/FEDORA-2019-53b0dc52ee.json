On the other\nhand, before a PV page may be used as a \"special\" page type (such as a\npagetable or descriptor table), it _must not_ be writable in the IOMMU\n(otherwise a malicious guest could DMA arbitrary page tables into the\nmemory, bypassing Xen's safety checks); and Xen's current rule is to\nhave such pages not in the IOMMU at all.\n\nUntil now, in order to accomplish this, the code has borrowed HVM\ndomain's \"physmap\" concept: When a page is assigned to a guest,\nguess_physmap_add_entry() is called, which for PV guests, will create\na writable IOMMU mapping; and when a page is removed,\nguest_physmap_remove_entry() is called, which will remove the mapping.\n\nAdditionally, when a page gains the PGT_writable page type, the page\nwill be added into the IOMMU; and when the page changes away from a\nPGT_writable type, the page will be removed from the IOMMU.\n\nUnfortunately, borrowing the \"physmap\" concept from HVM domains is\nproblematic. HVM domains have a lock on their p2m tables, ensuring\nsynchronization between modifications to the p2m; and all hypercall\nparameters must first be translated through the p2m before being used.\nTrying to mix this locked-and-gated approach with PV's lock-free\napproach leads to several races and inconsistencies."

HVM domains have a lock on their p2m tables, ensuring\nsynchronization between modifications to the p2m; and all hypercall\nparameters must first be translated through the p2m before being used.\nTrying to mix this locked-and-gated approach with PV's lock-free\napproach leads to several races and inconsistencies."
