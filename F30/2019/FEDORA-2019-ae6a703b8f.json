When Default Typing is enabled (either globally or for a specific property) for an externally exposed JSON endpoint, the service has the mysql-connector-java jar (8.0.14 or earlier) in the classpath, and an attacker can host a crafted MySQL server reachable by the victim, an attacker can send a crafted JSON message that allows them to read arbitrary local files on the server.

We may update the jackson-databind dependency in a future release.\n\nSimilarly, Satellite 6 does not enable polymorphic unmarshmalling, which is a required configuration for the vulnerability to be used. We may update the jackson-databind dependency in a future release.\n\nRed Hat OpenStack Platform ships OpenDaylight, which contains the vulnerable jackson-databind. However, OpenDaylight does not expose jackson-databind in a way that would make it vulnerable, lowering the impact of the vulnerability for OpenDaylight. As such, Red Hat will not be providing a fix for OpenDaylight at this time."
