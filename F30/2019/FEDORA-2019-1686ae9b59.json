The only way to fix it is to reinstall the package from scratch back to 5.6.\n\nVersion-Release number of selected component (if applicable):\nAffects npm 5.6 on Fedora 27 & 28\n\nHow reproducible:\nConsistent\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Start with a fresh Fedora: docker run -it fedora:28 /bin/bash\n2. Install npm: dnf install npm\n3. Update npm: npm update -g\n4. Run npm again, see error\n\nActual results:\nmodule.js:549\n    throw err;\n    ^\n\nError: Cannot find module 'npmlog'\n    at Function.Module._resolveFilename (module.js:547:15)\n    at Function.Module._load (module.js:474:25)\n    ....\n\nExpected results:\nnpm successfully upgraded from npm 5.6 to 5.8 (at the time of writing)\n\n\nAdditional info:\n\nThe bug is caused by the way Fedora packages npm.\n\nWe can see in https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/nodejs/blob/cc0d5eb2e643873f8dc448769370c274be00de1d/f/nodejs.spec#_370 that the node_modules that come with npm are actually in /lib/node_modules/npm/node_modules.bundled and are symlinked from /lib/node_modules/npm/node_modules.\n\nnpm wants to upgrade packages independent of their order, so it has strange logic that can remove a package while keeping its node_modules, this way the node_modules can be dealt with separately. The code that does it is here: https://github.com/npm/npm/blob/ee147fbbca6f2707d3b16f4fa78f4c4606b2d9b1/lib/install/action/remove.js#L13\n\nWhen npm tries to upgrade itself it first removes itself, (which means that it deletes everything in /usr/lib/node_modules/npm except node_modules) and then installs the new version in. As part of this action node_modules.bundled gets removed as well and all symlinks in /lib/node_modules/npm/node_modules break. \n\nAfter this npm is broken forever...\n\nWe probably need another way to package npm, because putting node_modules.bundled near the real node_modules breaks upgrade. Maybe we should put it in node_modules/.bundled?"

						"thetext": "The reason behind node_modules.bundled in our package was to provide us an escape-hatch if we ever decided to split out the npm subpackage from the nodejs SRPM again. It's a preventative workaround for https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:Directory_Replacement\n\nThat said, we've been largely successful with just using the version bundled by Node.js's tarball and I don't really see us wanting to go through the hassle of unbundling it again (especially since its dependency chain has been growing constantly). So we *could* just bite the bullet and decide that this is a permanent state of being.\n\nOptions: \n1) We could opt to move the node_modules.bundled folder to somewhere that it wouldn't get clobbered. If we did this, I think /usr/lib/node/.bundled/npm is probably the right place, as its out of the path of the deletion and still sufficiently unique that it can be managed easily.\n\n2) We can accept that we'll never try to unbundle npm again and just drop the symlink emergency hatch entirely.\n\n\nThat all being said, Tom is right: using `npm --global` is a recipe for disaster on an RPM-managed system (its changes WILL get overwritten by the next RPM update). It's far better to make per-user changes. But people are people and if they decide to do this (which is recommended by NPM itself, unfortunately...), I think we need to try really hard not to break on it.\n\nTom, which approach would you prefer?"

If you would still like \nto see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version \nof Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora \nversion prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.\n\nAlthough we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's \nlifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events.
