If I launch a separate instance\nof the browser it works okay.  Then if I close firefox and\ndo not use it for a while it goes back to the original state of not working.\n\nVersion-Release number of selected component (if applicable):\nfirefox-63.0.1-5.fc29.x86_64\n\nHow reproducible:\nas above.  leave the web browser not running for a while then start it up.\nvery frequently happens.\n\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. start web browser, assuming home page is https://www.google.com\n2. \n3.\n\nActual results:\nYour connection is not secure\n\nThe owner of www.google.com has configured their website improperly. To protect your information from being stolen, Firefox has not connected to this website.\n\nThis site uses HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) to specify that Firefox may only connect to it securely. As a result, it is not possible to add an exception for this certificate.\n\nLearn more…\n\nReport errors like this to help Mozilla identify and block malicious sites\n\nwww.google.com uses an invalid security certificate.\n\nThe certificate is not trusted because the issuer certificate is unknown.\nThe server might not be sending the appropriate intermediate certificates.\nAn additional root certificate may need to be imported.\n\nError code: SEC_ERROR_UNKNOWN_ISSUER\n\nclicking on SEC_ERROR_UNKNOWN_ISSUER gives the certificate shown\nin the attachment.\n\nAlso firefox takes a long time to load.\nCould have something to do with cookie settings.\n\nExpected results:\nprompt startup of firefox and load google homepage.\n\nAdditional info:\nsee attached certificate.\nThere are tons of error reports on the firefox website pertaining to this.\nlooks like jscher2000 does not think something is wrong and thinks firefox\nis configured incorrectly, but lots of people were complaining about this.\nNote:  I noticed that very briefly when firefox loads up, it flashes on the\nscreen one of those firefox home pages that you get when you first install\nor upgrade firefox.  Since this is a recently upgraded fedora from 28 to 29, \nI thought maybe it was getting stuck on that page (sort of like a \nsplash screen after the upgrade).\n\n--- Additional comment from  on 2018-11-11 02:05 UTC ---\n\n\n\n--- Additional comment from  on 2018-11-11 02:24:10 UTC ---\n\nI set the homepage to \"firefox default\" and it loads the fedora homepage.\nI think normally that goes away after the first time you see it, no?\n\n--- Additional comment from  on 2018-11-11 02:46:42 UTC ---\n\ngarberw@electron> lsof -i\nCOMMAND  PID    USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME\nfirefox 7657 garberw  107u  IPv6 101189      0t0  TCP electron:47954->nuq04s29-in-x04.1e100.net:https (ESTABLISHED)\nfirefox 7657 garberw  130u  IPv4 110195      0t0  TCP electron:55874->ec2-52-33-113-226.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:https (ESTABLISHED)\nfirefox 7657 garberw  153u  IPv4 123044      0t0  TCP electron:53006->sfo07s13-in-f14.1e100.net:https (ESTABLISHED)\nfirefox 7657 garberw  155u  IPv6 134139      0t0  TCP electron:54886->sfo03s07-in-x0e.1e100.net:https (ESTABLISHED)\nfirefox 7657 garberw  160u  IPv6 138242      0t0  TCP electron:39680->[2606:4700:20::6819:1c69]:https (ESTABLISHED)\nfirefox 7657 garberw  161u  IPv4 141060      0t0  TCP electron:46154->72.21.91.29:http (ESTABLISHED)\nfirefox 7657 garberw  166u  IPv6 138243      0t0  TCP electron:47464->[2a04:fa87:fffe::c000:4902]:https (ESTABLISHED)\nfirefox 7657 garberw  167u  IPv6 135950      0t0  TCP electron:46444->sfo07s13-in-x0a.1e100.net:https (ESTABLISHED)\nfirefox 7657 garberw  168u  IPv6 135785      0t0  TCP electron:46432->sfo07s13-in-x0a.1e100.net:https (ESTABLISHED)\nfirefox 7657 garberw  171u  IPv6 135786      0t0  TCP electron:44702->[2606:4700:30::681b:be68]:https (ESTABLISHED)\nfirefox 7657 garberw  172u  IPv6 138252      0t0  TCP electron:55254->nuq04s29-in-x03.1e100.net:https (ESTABLISHED)\ngarberw@electron> \n\n\nthat ipv6 address is spinasale.com.\ndoes this mean spinasale.com has hacked me?\nthe only thing open was google in firefox.\n\n--- Additional comment from  on 2018-11-11 04:01 UTC ---\n\nall defaults.

But it does not.  Also it gives the security error.\n\nCan someone please comment on this?\nI can not use the web browser decently.\n\nAlso the firefox website said this may be due to an incorrectly set system clock or timezone.\n\n--- Additional comment from Christian Stadelmann on 2019-02-17 11:08:34 UTC ---\n\n\n\n--- Additional comment from Christian Stadelmann on 2019-02-17 11:14:50 UTC ---\n\nIs your system time AND DATE correct? What does `$ date` give you when executed on the command line?\n\nIt looks like someone is messing with your internet connection and/or DNS server. Some ideas:\n* Have you set a DNS server? Try a different one or get back to the default.\n* Is your computer part of an untrusted network? Any public wifi is an untrusted network. Try a different (preferable cabled) network.\n* Is your ISP or government messing with your network? If possible, try a different one ;)\n\n--- Additional comment from  on 2019-02-18 18:25:50 UTC ---\n\nyes my system time and date are correct.\nI checked that the uefi is set to UTC and \nthe system time and date from \"date\" command\nare the local time (what I would expect).\nthe dns server was set to defaults.\nI reset it to google's dns server for ipv4 and ipv6\nand the problem persists.\n\nthere are tons of people reporting this problem.\n\n--- Additional comment from  on 2019-02-18 22:02:50 UTC ---\n\ngarberw@electron> date\nMon Feb 18 14:01:10 PST 2019\ngarberw@electron> \n\n\nthis seems to be a problem with firefox based on the firefox blogs.\nthere are lots of questions like this one I posted:\n\nhttps://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1248873#answer-1193593\n\n--- Additional comment from  on 2019-02-18 22:28:36 UTC ---\n\nsee there are a whole lot of people having this problem:\n\nhttps://www.google.com/search?source=hp&ei=MS9rXJ7tFMv4_Aa73bPYCQ&q=sec_error_unknown_issuer+firefox+google&btnK=Google+Search&oq=SEC_ERROR_UNKNOWN_ISSUER+&gs_l=psy-ab.3.2.0l10.11115.11115..16117...0.0..0.109.221.1j2......0....2j1..gws-wiz.....0.z0gKpk2U-xg\n\n--- Additional comment from  on 2019-02-18 23:03:45 UTC ---\n\nI removed ~/.mozilla and did\n# dnf remove firefox\n# dnf install firefox\nchange home page to \"custom\" https://www.google.com \nwas the only customization made.\n\nand the problem decreased.  I started and closed firefox 30 times,\nwith no problem, but on the 30th time the problem came back.\nI am running mate desktop and the shortcut for firefox has the\ncommand \"firefox %u\".

If I then quit Firefox completely then re-open it will occur again. I've tried this several times and it seems to reliably happen every other time I open Firefox as long as the homepage is set to https://duckduckgo.com. I have other machines running Slackware and one Mac with Firefox ESR and Firefox respectively and they do not exhibit this issue so I believe it may be a setting in about:config or some sort of build option used with the Fedora Firefox package\n\n\nVersion-Release number of selected component (if applicable): Fedora 30/Firefox 69\n\n\nHow reproducible: Every other time\n\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Set homepage to \"https://duckduckgo.com\"\n2. Close Firefox\n3. Open and close Firefox several times in a row\n\nActual results:\nEvery other time a warning is displayed\n\nExpected results:\nhttps://duckduckgo.com should load with no warnings\n\nAdditional info:\nIf you continue to browse to other HTTPS sites signed by DigiCert a similar warning is showed unless you (again) completely quit Firefox and re-open with no error; then DigiCert signed certificates will work as expected"

What changes based on the order the pages are loaded is the state of your NSS certificate cache. Based on this, I think I might have found a reproducer: remove all DigiCert intermediate certificates from the certificate cache. Normally this should be safe to do, but due to this bug it causes Firefox to break. I have no clue what is going wrong here between NSS and p11-kit, but hopefully this will help any developers unable to reproduce.\n\nSince loading any webpage could affect this, best to first close all tabs except duckduckgo.com and set Firefox to restore previous tabs on startup to ensure a clean environment. Then: go to Preferences -> Privacy & Security -> scroll to the bottom -> View Certificates... -> Authorities. Scroll down to DigiCert Inc. Delete or Distrust every DigiCert certificate that is labeled Software Security Device. (You should *probably* only need to delete one, DigiCert SHA2 Secure Server CA, but deleting them all is what I just tested.) When doing this, be very careful not to Delete or Distrust any certificate labeled Default Trust, because those are trust roots that should not be messed with. The UI here is very confusing, but I believe the Software Security Device label indicates an intermediate certificate that is not included in ca-certificates and which can safely be deleted, because it will just be cached again next time it is encountered. The button will only delete these certificates from the cache, not cause these certificates to be distrusted, as would happen if deleting a root. (Thus, deleting the intermediate certificate is normally almost pointless. Only in combination with this bug does cause trust errors. I think.) Finally, restart Firefox. Firefox will initially display duckduckgo.com with no issues, but only because it is being restored from previous session state cache. Now, refresh the page and you should encounter the certificate error.\n\nOne caveat: I don't know how to get my Firefox out of this broken state, and that means I can't test to be certain that following those steps once again will successfully break my Firefox. I just know that it seems to have worked for me the first time I tried it."

If I start FF and then wait for the \"timer\" thing to finish in the gnome-shell top panel (where it says \"firefox\") and then load duckduckgo.com or netflix.com, everything works just fine. If, however, something tries to open before the timer is finished---a tab from a previous session, for example, the the cert error thing keeps coming up for the rest of the session. So, ff is trying to load something here? How can one get some information on what it is doing maybe?"
