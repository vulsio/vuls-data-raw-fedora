This is useful to allow internal code paths to be standardized around Kerberos.\n\nS4U2Proxy (constrained-delegation) is an extension of this mechanism allowing this impersonation to a second service over the network.

This allows a man-in-the-middle attacker who can intercept the request to the KDC to modify the packet by replacing the user name (principal) in the request with any desired user name (principal) that exists in the KDC and replace the checksum protecting that name with a CRC32 checksum (which requires no prior knowledge to compute).\n\nThis would allow a S4U2Self ticket requested on behalf of user name (principal) user@EXAMPLE.COM to any service to be changed to a S4U2Self ticket with a user name (principal) of Administrator@EXAMPLE.COM.
