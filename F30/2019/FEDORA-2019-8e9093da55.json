	"notes": "FreeIPA 4.8.3 is a security update release that includes fixes for two issues:\n\n*  CVE-2019-10195: Don't log passwords embedded in commands in calls using batch A flaw was found in the way that FreeIPA's batch processing API logged operations. This included passing user passwords in clear text on FreeIPA masters. Batch processing of commands with passwords as arguments or options is not performed by default in FreeIPA but is possible by third-party components. An attacker having access to system logs on FreeIPA masters could use this flaw to produce log file content with passwords exposed. The issue was reported by Jamison Bennett from Cloudera\n\n*  CVE-2019-14867: Make sure to have storage space for tag A flaw was found in the way the internal function ber_scanf() was used in some components of the IPA server, which parsed kerberos key data. An unauthenticated attacker who could trigger parsing of the krb principal key could cause the IPA server to crash or in some conditions, cause arbitrary code to be executed on the server hosting the IPA server. The issue was reported by Todd Lipcon from Cloudera\n\n\n",
