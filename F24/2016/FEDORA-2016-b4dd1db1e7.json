Install lxc and set-up one container inside of the fresh installation of Fedora 24 (beta/KDE/x64_86);\n2. enable lxc-net service (systemctl enable lxc-net.service);\n3. make the container starts on boot:\nlxc.start.auto = 1\nlxc.group = onboot\n4. reboot\n\nActual results:\nJun 06 23:52:35 localhost lxc-net[1082]: dnsmasq: directory /etc/resolv.conf for resolv-file is missing, cannot poll\nJun 06 23:52:35 localhost dnsmasq[1194]: directory /etc/resolv.conf for resolv-file is missing, cannot poll\nJun 06 23:52:35 localhost dnsmasq[1194]: FAILED to start up\n\nContainer didn't start because lxc-net.service failed to start up.\n\nExpected results:\nTo have containers up and running after booting Fedora.\n\nAdditional info:\n/etc/resolv.conf is created by NetworkManager during the boot sequence (/etc/resolv.conf -> /var/run/NetworkManager/resolv.conf), hence I assume that this is an issue of service ordering in systemd, but I don't see how exactly.\nlxc-net.service is waiting for network-online.target and network-online.target\nis depending on NetworkManager-wait-online.service, i.e. when NetworkManager is ready."

If you would still like \nto see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version \nof Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora \nversion prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.\n\nAlthough we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's \nlifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events.
