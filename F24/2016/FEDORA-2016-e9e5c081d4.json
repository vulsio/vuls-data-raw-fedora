						"thetext": "The following issue was reported by Perl upstream:\n\nThe problem relates to Perl 5 (\"perl\") loading modules from the includes directory array (\"@INC\") in which the last element is the current directory (\".\"). That means that, when \"perl\" wants to load a module (during first compilation or during lazy loading of a module in run-time), perl will look for the module in the current directory at the end, since '.' is the last include directory in its array of include directories to seek. The issue is with requiring libraries that are in \".\" but are not otherwise installed.\n\nThe major problem with this behavior is that it unexpectedly puts a user at risk whenever they execute any Perl scripts from a directory that is writable by other accounts on the system. For instance, if a user is logged in as root and changes directory into /tmp or an account's home directory, it is possible to now run any shell commands that are written in C, Python or Ruby without fear.\n\nThe same isn't true for any shell commands that are written in Perl, since a significant proportion of Perl scripts will execute code in the current working directory whenever they are run. For example, if a user on a shared system creates the file /tmp/Pod/Perldoc/Toterm.pm, and then I log in as root, change directory to /tmp, and run \"perldoc perlrun\", it will execute the code they have placed in the file.\n\nThe most severe example discovered on Debian is that apt-get will load and execute the /tmp/Log/Agent.pm file regardless of the directory it is started from since it automatically changes directory to /tmp.\n\nThis is present in perl versions 5.24 and below. We will be making additional maintenance releases of 5.24, 5.22 (current supported versions), and (as an exception, probably) 5.20 (which is no longer officially supported) which will include the fix for it.\n\nThe fix, supplied in the attached patches, is to check if the last entry of @INC is \".\" and if so, to remove it as an included path."

It only patches every module bundled with upstream Perl (i.e. core modules) that loads another module which is deemed not to be delivered within upstream Perl (i.e. non-core modules).\n\nThat is instead of not having \".\" in the default interpreter @INC array (see last lines of \"perl -V\" output), it changes some modules that do something like this:\n\neval \"require $module\";\n\nin this manner:\n\n+    local @INC = @INC;\n+    pop @INC if $INC[-1] eq '.';\n     eval \"require $module\";\n\nThat has these consequences:\n\n(1) It does not fix any of the thousands of modules distributed from CPAN or another upstream. And many of them are delivered by Fedora.\n\n(2) Applying the patches to perl package in Fedora will keep vulnerable Fedora packages that supersede some Perl core modules (i.e. dual-lived modules). E.g. Locale::Maketext module is delivered from perl-Locale-Maketext source package in Fedora. Not from perl source package. That means cloning this vulnerability to perl component is not enough. It should be cloned to perl-Locale-Maketext too. And probably to tens of other Fedora components.\n\n(3) It's possible that even plain \"require Foo::Bar;\" code not in the eval argument possess the vulnerability in Fedora. Even if Foo::Bar were core module. That's because Foo::Bar module can be delivered by a binary package that is not required when installing package that does the \"require Foo::Bar;\". Either on purpose or as a packaging bug. While I consider this case as improbable (upstream worked very hard on the patches, Fedora tries to specify all dependencies between packages), I cannot exclude it.\n\nFedora maintainers will deliver the upstream patches as part of new perl versions 5.22.3 and 5.24.1 in the beginning of August. Fedora maintainers will patch the dual-lived modules independently.\n\nDue to nature of this bug, Fedora maintainers are pondering removing the \".\" path from the default @INC globally on the perl interpreter level. At least in F26 and probably F25. And adding the \".\" to the specific few modules that depends on it (inc::latest, inc::Module::Install)."

The thing is that \".\" has been in @INC for way too long, and hence it's relied on, and its removal will cause breakage.  The info we got indicates that upstream may proceed with removing it in the future versions, but it's quite a big change for minor release.  Hence this partial and more complicated fix to address recently-discovered cases where this issue has significant impact."

						"thetext": "I think this frankly a bad fix for the wrong problem.  Removing the . may cause problems but doing it at the module level is likely to have very serious side effects.  I am of the view that merely compiling a module should not have side effects.  A patch suggested in most places (i.e Peter's patch above minus the dynamic scoping) adds very strange order-dependent bugs to programs.  At least insisting that @INC should be localized bfore the modification helps.   But changing inc just because a module was compiled strikes me as very, very bad practice and in fact I have been bitten by the order-dependent implications of the Debian approach to this \"fix\" already.\n\nThe problem is not that a Perl module might include stuff from the wrong directories.  The problem is that a perl *script* might.  So I think the security concern here is rather badly scoped.  This is NOT a module vulnerability unless modules are *adding* . to the INC directory.\n\nThe right way, I think, to see this problem is that a program might not be written to address the implications of the INC directory.  So if the concern is that if someone has a nightly run of prove running as root in their /tmp directory then the correct solution is to add to bin/prove:\n\nno lib '.';\n\nThat fixes the problem nicely and far more completely than the proposed fix here does and it does so without side effects.  Keeping the fix limited to scripts rather than libraries ensures that exploits are prevented and that breakage is not a real problem.  Insisting that one fixes it by removing the current directory from any possible position in @INC also means it cannot be carelessly added back in by using the -I. flag.\n\nSo the proposed fix is rather overinclusive (and needlessly breaking) and underinclusive (in no way eliminating the vulnerabilities)."

								"thetext": "The following issue was reported by Perl upstream:\n\nThe problem relates to Perl 5 (\"perl\") loading modules from the includes directory array (\"@INC\") in which the last element is the current directory (\".\"). That means that, when \"perl\" wants to load a module (during first compilation or during lazy loading of a module in run-time), perl will look for the module in the current directory at the end, since '.' is the last include directory in its array of include directories to seek. The issue is with requiring libraries that are in \".\" but are not otherwise installed.\n\nThe major problem with this behavior is that it unexpectedly puts a user at risk whenever they execute any Perl scripts from a directory that is writable by other accounts on the system. For instance, if a user is logged in as root and changes directory into /tmp or an account's home directory, it is possible to now run any shell commands that are written in C, Python or Ruby without fear.\n\nThe same isn't true for any shell commands that are written in Perl, since a significant proportion of Perl scripts will execute code in the current working directory whenever they are run. For example, if a user on a shared system creates the file /tmp/Pod/Perldoc/Toterm.pm, and then I log in as root, change directory to /tmp, and run \"perldoc perlrun\", it will execute the code they have placed in the file.\n\nThe most severe example discovered on Debian is that apt-get will load and execute the /tmp/Log/Agent.pm file regardless of the directory it is started from since it automatically changes directory to /tmp.\n\nThis is present in perl versions 5.24 and below. We will be making additional maintenance releases of 5.24, 5.22 (current supported versions), and (as an exception, probably) 5.20 (which is no longer officially supported) which will include the fix for it.\n\nThe fix, supplied in the attached patches, is to check if the last entry of @INC is \".\" and if so, to remove it as an included path."

It only patches every module bundled with upstream Perl (i.e. core modules) that loads another module which is deemed not to be delivered within upstream Perl (i.e. non-core modules).\n\nThat is instead of not having \".\" in the default interpreter @INC array (see last lines of \"perl -V\" output), it changes some modules that do something like this:\n\neval \"require $module\";\n\nin this manner:\n\n+    local @INC = @INC;\n+    pop @INC if $INC[-1] eq '.';\n     eval \"require $module\";\n\nThat has these consequences:\n\n(1) It does not fix any of the thousands of modules distributed from CPAN or another upstream. And many of them are delivered by Fedora.\n\n(2) Applying the patches to perl package in Fedora will keep vulnerable Fedora packages that supersede some Perl core modules (i.e. dual-lived modules). E.g. Locale::Maketext module is delivered from perl-Locale-Maketext source package in Fedora. Not from perl source package. That means cloning this vulnerability to perl component is not enough. It should be cloned to perl-Locale-Maketext too. And probably to tens of other Fedora components.\n\n(3) It's possible that even plain \"require Foo::Bar;\" code not in the eval argument possess the vulnerability in Fedora. Even if Foo::Bar were core module. That's because Foo::Bar module can be delivered by a binary package that is not required when installing package that does the \"require Foo::Bar;\". Either on purpose or as a packaging bug. While I consider this case as improbable (upstream worked very hard on the patches, Fedora tries to specify all dependencies between packages), I cannot exclude it.\n\nFedora maintainers will deliver the upstream patches as part of new perl versions 5.22.3 and 5.24.1 in the beginning of August. Fedora maintainers will patch the dual-lived modules independently.\n\nDue to nature of this bug, Fedora maintainers are pondering removing the \".\" path from the default @INC globally on the perl interpreter level. At least in F26 and probably F25. And adding the \".\" to the specific few modules that depends on it (inc::latest, inc::Module::Install)."

The thing is that \".\" has been in @INC for way too long, and hence it's relied on, and its removal will cause breakage.  The info we got indicates that upstream may proceed with removing it in the future versions, but it's quite a big change for minor release.  Hence this partial and more complicated fix to address recently-discovered cases where this issue has significant impact."

								"thetext": "I think this frankly a bad fix for the wrong problem.  Removing the . may cause problems but doing it at the module level is likely to have very serious side effects.  I am of the view that merely compiling a module should not have side effects.  A patch suggested in most places (i.e Peter's patch above minus the dynamic scoping) adds very strange order-dependent bugs to programs.  At least insisting that @INC should be localized bfore the modification helps.   But changing inc just because a module was compiled strikes me as very, very bad practice and in fact I have been bitten by the order-dependent implications of the Debian approach to this \"fix\" already.\n\nThe problem is not that a Perl module might include stuff from the wrong directories.  The problem is that a perl *script* might.  So I think the security concern here is rather badly scoped.  This is NOT a module vulnerability unless modules are *adding* . to the INC directory.\n\nThe right way, I think, to see this problem is that a program might not be written to address the implications of the INC directory.  So if the concern is that if someone has a nightly run of prove running as root in their /tmp directory then the correct solution is to add to bin/prove:\n\nno lib '.';\n\nThat fixes the problem nicely and far more completely than the proposed fix here does and it does so without side effects.  Keeping the fix limited to scripts rather than libraries ensures that exploits are prevented and that breakage is not a real problem.  Insisting that one fixes it by removing the current directory from any possible position in @INC also means it cannot be carelessly added back in by using the -I. flag.\n\nSo the proposed fix is rather overinclusive (and needlessly breaking) and underinclusive (in no way eliminating the vulnerabilities)."
