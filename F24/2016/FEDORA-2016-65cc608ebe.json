It report error message: \"Unable to complete install: 'unsupported configuration: videoram must be at least 8MB for CIRRUS'\" and when I add a \"CIRRUS\" type video device the RAM is set by default below the requirement, so still cannot start the HVM guest installation.\nActually install xen fullvirt guest via Network Boot (PXE) with the same CIRRUS RAM default size (8192) is successful, and also OK if importing a existing disk image.\n\nVersion-Release number of selected component (if applicable):\nHost: Fedora24 development version with latest packages:\nkerenl-4.5.4-300.fc24.x86_64\nxen-4.6.1-8.fc24.x86_64\nlibvirt-1.3.3.1-1.fc24.x86_64\nvirt-manager-1.3.2-3.fc24.noarch\n\nGuest: RHEL6.8 with:\nkernel-2.6.32-642.el6.x86_64\n\nvirt-manager version on RHEL7.2:\nvirt-manager-1.3.2-1.el7.noarch\n\nHow reproducible: Always\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Start virt-manager and connect localhost or remote xen-4.6.1-8 hypervisor.\n2. At virt-manager GUI create a new virtual machine, Select below options:\n   Connection: Xen\n   Choose how you would like to install the operating system: Network Install (HTTP,FTP, or NFS)\n   Xen Type: xen(fullvirt)\n   And Press Forward.\n3. File the URL with the compose link, select Forward and keep the setting as default, then press Finish to start the installation.\n4. Installation cannot start with the error message \"Unable to complete install: 'unsupported configuration: videoram must be at least 8MB for CIRRUS'\" displays and detailed information will add in additional info 1.\n5. Click \"Close\" and select \"Customize configuration before install\", press \"Finish\" to configure the installation, remove the default type video device and press \"Add Hardware\" to add a Video device, select \"Cirrus\" model and press \"Begin Installation\".\n\nActual results:\nInstallation failed to start with error message \"Unable to complete install: 'internal error: libxenlight failed to create new domain 'rhel6.8''\". Details are as below:\n\nUnable to complete install: 'internal error: libxenlight failed to create new domain 'rhel6.8''\n\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/share/virt-manager/virtManager/asyncjob.py\", line 89, in cb_wrapper\n    callback(asyncjob, *args, **kwargs)\n  File \"/usr/share/virt-manager/virtManager/create.py\", line 1855, in do_install\n    guest.start_install(meter=meter)\n  File \"/usr/share/virt-manager/virtinst/guest.py\", line 411, in start_install\n    noboot)\n  File \"/usr/share/virt-manager/virtinst/guest.py\", line 475, in _create_guest\n    dom = self.conn.createLinustart_xml or final_xml, 0)\n  File \"/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/libvirt.py\", line 3440, in createLinux\n    if ret is None:raise libvirtError('virDomainCreateLinu) failed', conn=self)\nlibvirtError: internal error: libxenlight failed to create new domain 'rhel6.8'\n\nExpected results:  \nThe installation should be start successfully.\n\nAdditional info:\n1. The details of error message \"Unable to complete install: 'unsupported configuration: videoram must be at least 8MB for CIRRUS'\" in step 4 are as below:\n\nUnable to complete install: 'unsupported configuration: videoram must be at least 8MB for CIRRUS'\n\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/share/virt-manager/virtManager/asyncjob.py\", line 89, in cb_wrapper\n    callback(asyncjob, *args, **kwargs)\n  File \"/usr/share/virt-manager/virtManager/create.py\", line 1855, in do_install\n    guest.start_install(meter=meter)\n  File \"/usr/share/virt-manager/virtinst/guest.py\", line 411, in start_install\n    noboot)\n  File \"/usr/share/virt-manager/virtinst/guest.py\", line 475, in _create_guest\n    dom = self.conn.createLinustart_xml or final_xml, 0)\n  File \"/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/libvirt.py\", line 3440, in createLinux\n    if ret is None:raise libvirtError('virDomainCreateLinu) failed', conn=self)\nlibvirtError: unsupported configuration: videoram must be at least 8MB for CIRRUS\n\n2. I have tried guests of RHEL5, RHEL6, RHEL7 and Fedora, all guests have this problem.\n3. Installing xen fullvirt guest by other method with default type video device also reports the videoram added limitation error, but after adding a CIRRUS type video device the installation can be started, such as Local install media (ISO image or CDROM), Network Boot (PXE) and Import existing disk image.\n4. The error also can be reproduced on Fedora23 xen-4.5.3-4.fc23 hypervisor but it doesn't report videoram limitation error, it report the libxenlight failed error directly as in the actual results with the default video device.\n5. The error also can be reproduced with upstream virt-manager-1.3.2-3.fc24."
