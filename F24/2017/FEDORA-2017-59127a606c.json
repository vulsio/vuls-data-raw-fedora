A server that relies solely on TSIG keys for protection with no other ACL protection could be manipulated into:\n\n* providing an AXFR of a zone to an unauthorized recipient\n* accepting bogus Notify packets\n\nAn unauthorized AXFR (full zone transfer) permits an attacker to view the entire contents of a zone.  Protection of zone contents is often a commercial or business requirement.\n\nIf accepted, a Notify sets the zone refresh interval to 'now'. If there is not already a refresh cycle in progress then named will initiate one by asking for the SOA RR from its list of masters.  If there is already a refresh cycle in progress, then named will queue the new refresh request.  If there is already a queued refresh request, the new Notify will be discarded. Bogus notifications can't be used to force a zone transfer from a malicious server, but could trigger a high rate of zone refresh cycles.\n\n\nWorkarounds:\n\nThe effects of this vulnerability can be mitigated by using Access Control Lists (ACLs) that require both address range validation and use of TSIG authentication in parallel.
