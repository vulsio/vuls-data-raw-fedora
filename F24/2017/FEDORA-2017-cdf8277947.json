Onionshare uses /tmp/onionshare to create a temporary directory $HS that is then used for the creation of a tor hidden service, as HiddenServiceDir configuration.  Then, the tor daemon creates 2 files in $HS\n\nBut onionshare doesn't verify the owner or the exact permission of /tmp/onionshare.  So if a attacker pre-create a directory /tmp/onionshare with 777 permissions and him as a owner, he can use a race condition to inject his own files in the share.\n\nReferences:\n\nhttp://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q2/392\n\nVulnerable code:\n\nhttps://github.com/micahflee/onionshare/blob/master/onionshare/hs.py#L105"
