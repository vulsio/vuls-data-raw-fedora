So the subpackage could be called e.g. 'server-utils' and would include all non-essential utilities (including all the perl scripts).\n\nHowever, I'd rather consult this with the upstream first, since if they by any chance plan to re-implement more utilities in perl, instead of bash, then it wouldn't be a good idea to try get rid of perl dependencies.. Also, we got quite close to upstream rpm layout with our packages, which makes it easier for users to use them.. So, I'd like to see the same subpackage in the upstream rpms as well.\n\nJakub, what do you think?"
