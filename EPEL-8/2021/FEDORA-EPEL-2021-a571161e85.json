In the remove (unsubscription) case, the recursive calls are NOT tail calls, so even with optimizations the stack grows linearly with the length of a subscription topic. Topics are under the control of remote clients - they can send a subscription to arbitrary length topics. An attacker can thus cause a server to create an mtrie sufficiently large such that, when unsubscribing, traversal will cause a stack overflow.\n\nReferences:\n\nhttps://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/pull/3959\nhttps://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/security/advisories/GHSA-qq65-x72m-9wr8\nhttps://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=22488"
