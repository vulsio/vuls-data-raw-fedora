Some packagers have to deal with lots of packages, so they build the ones they're specifically asked for, at least at first.\n\nFor repository-wide issues that span multiple packages, the EPEL development list would be the best place to go:\nhttps://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/epel-devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/"
