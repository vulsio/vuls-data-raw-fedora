I expected smtpd to send it later, when I start it, but the message just kept sitting in /var/spool/smtpd/offline. Then I retested this on Fedora 31, and found that it is also affected.\n\nVersion-Release number of selected component (if applicable): opensmtpd-6.0.3p1-8\n\n# ls -l /etc/alternatives/mta\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 28 Nov 29 13:59 /etc/alternatives/mta -> /usr/sbin/sendmail.opensmtpd\n\nHow reproducible: always\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\n1. dnf install opensmtpd\n2. systemctl start opensmtpd  # so that it creates the hierarchy under /var/spool/smtpd\n3. systemctl stop opensmtpd  # let's pretend it was stopped and forgotten by accident\n4. Use a text editor co create a \"mail.txt\" file, containing some valid mail headers, a blank line, and a body, suitable for submission to sendmail\n5. sendmail -f you@yourmail.com -t < mail.txt\n6. As a user, it says \"cannot create temporary file /var/spool/smtpd/offline/1575154903.XXXXMn5Om8: Permission denied\". As root, it returns error code 75 and puts the email into /var/spool/smtpd/offline, as expected\n7. systemctl start opensmtpd\n\nActual results: the offline message sits in /var/spool/smtpd/offline forever.\n\nExpected results: smtpd should pick up the offline message and send it out.\n\nAdditional info:\n\nThis has been traced to the fact that the package installs /usr/sbin/smtpctl (pointed to by /usr/sbin/sendmail.opensmtpd) with the wrong permissions. Upstream expects /usr/sbin/smtpctl to be setgid to the same group that owns /var/spool/smtpd/offline, while Fedora's package installs it setgid root.\n\nSee:\n\n# ls -ld /var/spool/smtpd/offline/\ndrwxrwx--- 2 root smtpq 6 Nov 29 14:04 /var/spool/smtpd/offline/\n\nUpstream code that checks permissions on offline queue files: https://github.com/OpenSMTPD/OpenSMTPD/blob/c139eb1610e931739d6cde4194c9560124b08165/smtpd/smtpd.c#L1604\n\nUpstream fix: https://github.com/OpenSMTPD/OpenSMTPD/commit/e02d05d2ec470899363de4be658aca26de5a2466"
