						"thetext": "Please add qt5-qtsvg as an explicit dependency for gitqlient.\n\nI recently installed Gitqlient on my machine running CentOS 8 Linux, and I noticed it was missing all of the usual icons in its buttons and menus. So, without any text except when you hover, the row of buttons near the top of the window were all invisible; I could only tell the buttons even existed because of the vertical line separating different sections.\n\nTurns out I was missing the package qt5-qtsvg. Once I manually installed that, Gitqlient showed all the button icons again.\n\nSorta funny since I didn't have this issue on other computers running the same distro. It probably should have been required by one of the other Qt packages... But still, since Gitqlient is kinda broken without qt5-qtsvg, I would argue that it should be explicitly required.\n\nThis was only a problem for me, so far, on CentOS 8 using the EPEL 8 repo, but I think it would make just as much sense for the main Fedora package to require qt5-qtsvg too."
