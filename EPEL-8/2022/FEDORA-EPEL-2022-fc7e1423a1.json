						"thetext": "django-filter is a generic system for filtering Django QuerySets based on user selections. In django-filter before version 2.4.0, automatically generated `NumberFilter` instances, whose value was later converted to an integer, were subject to potential DoS from maliciously input using exponential format with sufficiently large exponents. Version 2.4.0+ applies a `MaxValueValidator` with a a default `limit_value` of 1e50 to the form field used by `NumberFilter` instances. In addition, `NumberFilter` implements the new `get_max_validator()` which should return a configured validator instance to customise the limit, or else `None` to disable the additional validation. Users may manually apply an equivalent validator if they are not able to upgrade.\n\nReferences:\n\nhttps://github.com/carltongibson/django-filter/security/advisories/GHSA-x7gm-rfgv-w973\nhttps://github.com/carltongibson/django-filter/commit/340cf7a23a2b3dcd7183f6a0d6c383e85b130d2b\nhttps://pypi.org/project/django-filter/\nhttps://github.com/carltongibson/django-filter/releases/tag/2.4.0"

As I have different view on this.\n\nhmm, if you agree with NIST, I'm happy to change it, it was a first pass attempt. I think a full denial of service should be AC=high and I put AV as local assuming one would need access to the system to send input, but I can see a scenario where network makes sense. What do you think makes sense here?"
