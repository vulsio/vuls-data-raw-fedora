A side effect of that is that the plugin system will be broken.  I don't think it's worth doing the same for the older Fedora releases.\n\nHaving done all that, there have been significant other bugs found in the upstream 3.5.0, so I do not plan to promote 3.5.0 to stable.  A 3.5.1 is expected soon."
