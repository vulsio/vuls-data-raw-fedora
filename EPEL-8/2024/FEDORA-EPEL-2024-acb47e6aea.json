	"notes": "# libopenmpt 0.7.6 (2024-03-24)\n\n  * [Sec] Potential heap out-of-bounds read or write past sample end with malformed sustain loops in SymMOD files (r20420).\n  * MED: Transposed samples were playing too low in some files (e.g. mix94.mmd1).\n  * OKT: Some files with garbage at the end were rejected (e.g. katharsis - piano lesson.okta).\n  * Compressor DMO: It was possible that the plugin would not behave as intended at mix rates above 500 kHz.\n  * Avoid re-allocating the loop state map contents on every playthrough of the module.\n\n# libopenmpt 0.7.5 (2024-03-17)\n\n  * [Sec] Null-pointer write (32bit platforms) or excessive memory allocation (64bit platforms) when reading close to 4GiB of data from unseekable files (r20336, r20338).\n  * [Sec] Write buffer overflow when reading unseekable files close to 4GiB in size (r20339).\n  * [Sec] Possible out-of-memory (32bit platforms) or excessive memory allocation (64bit platforms) when reading malformed data from unseekable files (r20340).\n  * [Sec] DMF: Possible null-pointer write or excessive memory allocation when reading DMF files (r20323).\n  * IT: In the previous version, Zxx macros in IT files made with older MPT versions were no longer working.\n  * There was a periodic click when playing a module using the Chorus or Flanger DMO plugin at a mix rate exceeding ~136.5 kHz.\n  * An older bugfix for undefined behaviour in the Distortion DMO plugin was incorrect, causing the distorted sound to be different in some situations.\n  * xmp-openmpt: Metadata retrievel for playlist items was broken.\n\n# libopenmpt 0.7.4 (2024-03-03)\n\n  * [Bug] Makefile: libopenmpt 0.7.3 broke running the test suite for Emscripten builds.\n  * openmpt123: openmpt123 now uses a narrower layout on terminal windows with a width of less than 72 characters.\n  * Setting all possible `load_skip` flags resulted in nothing being loaded at all, instead of just not loading the selected module parts.\n  * When playing all subsongs, `set_position_seconds` didn’t always calculate the correct subsong to jump to.\n  * IT: A few more compatibility flags are now disabled for modules saved with earlier Schism Tracker versions.\n  * IT: MIDI macros were reset in IT 2.14 / 2.15 files that declared to be compatible with older IT versions (fixes spx-visionsofthepast.it).\n  * OKT: Work around missing negative arpeggio implementation by transposing the notes up an octave.\n  * OKT: Channel volume commands were sometimes lost over less important effects.\n  * IMF: Ignore magic bytes in sample header. “Leaving All Behind” by Karsten Koch uses unexpected magic bytes, Orpheus ignores them just like the instrument header magic bytes.\n  * zlib: Update to v1.3.1 (2024-01-22).\n  * mpg123: Update to v1.32.5 (2024-02-17).\n  * pugixml: Update to v1.14 (2023-10-01).",
