This may affect the ability to promptly identify and raise bugs for security issues affecting the bundled dependencies, which include:\n\n* Numerous Go modules\n* A patched version of squashfuse\n\nRef: https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/apptainer/blob/epel7/f/apptainer.spec\n\nIt's my understanding that declaring bundled dependencies is a MUST requirement for Fedora / EPEL packaging.\n\nSee: https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/#bundling\n\n> All packages whose upstreams have no mechanism to build against system libraries MAY opt to carry bundled libraries, but if they do, they MUST include an indication of what they bundle. This provides a mechanism for locating libraries with bundled code which can, for example, assist in locating packages which may have particular security vulnerabilities.\n\n\nHow reproducible: Always\n\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Examine build's inclusion of dependencies\n2. Compare to spec file provides\n\n\nActual results: Spec file does not declare dependencies.\n\n\nExpected results: Spec file declares dependencies using 'Provides: bundled(golang(xxxx))' etc.\n\n\nAdditional info:"
