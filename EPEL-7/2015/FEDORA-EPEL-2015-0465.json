						"thetext": "This does not seem to be a buffer overflow issue.  The problem that was reported is that if HAVE_VLA is defined, size of the stack-based splitbuf[] or joinbuf[] is determined at runtime based on the values from the processed image.  This approach has drawback that there's no real error check used - allocation of the buffer is done by subtracting from the stack pointer.  As a consequence, splitbuf[] / joinbuf[] start may be outside of the stack memory - typically unmapped memory, but may reach to stack memory of other threads and possibly heap memory.  Use of such buffer leads to memory corruption.  Given how those buffers are used, program will crash on attempt to access unmapped memory before the end of the affected functions is reached.  Hence exploit would require race against other thread or signal handler.\n\nProposed fix removes the use of variable length arrays, which make jasper use fixed size stack array, or allocate memory from heap if larger buffer is needed.\n\n(In reply to Jiri Popelka from comment #2)\n> Can you perhaps upload such file(s) ?\n\nNo reproducer is available, oCERT / original reporter may or may not be able to provide one.\n\n> > Fix proposal: remove the VLA code (see attached patch).\n> \n> This can more easily be achieved by not defining HAVE_VLA, see my patch.\n\nAgree, either approach should work.  As HAVE_VLA is not used elsewhere in the jasper sources, fixes should be equivalent.  Complete removal makes it less likely to have code re-enabled by accident in the future."

								"thetext": "This does not seem to be a buffer overflow issue.  The problem that was reported is that if HAVE_VLA is defined, size of the stack-based splitbuf[] or joinbuf[] is determined at runtime based on the values from the processed image.  This approach has drawback that there's no real error check used - allocation of the buffer is done by subtracting from the stack pointer.  As a consequence, splitbuf[] / joinbuf[] start may be outside of the stack memory - typically unmapped memory, but may reach to stack memory of other threads and possibly heap memory.  Use of such buffer leads to memory corruption.  Given how those buffers are used, program will crash on attempt to access unmapped memory before the end of the affected functions is reached.  Hence exploit would require race against other thread or signal handler.\n\nProposed fix removes the use of variable length arrays, which make jasper use fixed size stack array, or allocate memory from heap if larger buffer is needed.\n\n(In reply to Jiri Popelka from comment #2)\n> Can you perhaps upload such file(s) ?\n\nNo reproducer is available, oCERT / original reporter may or may not be able to provide one.\n\n> > Fix proposal: remove the VLA code (see attached patch).\n> \n> This can more easily be achieved by not defining HAVE_VLA, see my patch.\n\nAgree, either approach should work.  As HAVE_VLA is not used elsewhere in the jasper sources, fixes should be equivalent.  Complete removal makes it less likely to have code re-enabled by accident in the future."
