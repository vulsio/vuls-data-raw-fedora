This makes NTLM special and a subject for special treatment in the\ncode. With NTLM, once the connection is authenticated, no further\nauthentication is necessary until the connection gets closed.\n\nlibcurl's connection re-use logic will select an existing connection for\nre-use when asked to do a request, and when asked to use NTLM libcurl have to\npick a connection with matching credentials only.\n\nIf a connection was first setup and used for an NTLM HTTP request with a\nspecific set of credentials, that same connection could later wrongly get\nre-used in a subsequent HTTP request that was made to the same host - but\nwithout having any credentials set! Since an NTLM connection was already\nauthenticated due to how NTLM works, the subsequent request could then get\nsent over the wrong connection appearing as the initial user.\n\nWe are not aware of any exploits of this flaw.\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Daniel Stenberg (curl upstream) for reporting this issue.

Together with each\nindividual cookie there are several different properties, but for this\nvulnerability we focus on the associated \"path\" element. It tells information\nabout for which path on a given host the cookies is valid.\n\nThe internal libcurl function called `sanitize_cookie_path()` that cleans up\nthe path element as given to it from a remote site or when read from a file,\ndid not properly validate the input. If given a path that consisted of a\nsingle double-quote, libcurl would index a newly allocated memory area with\nindex -1 and assign a zero to it, thus destroying heap memory it wasn't\nsupposed to.\n\nAt best, this gets unnoticed but can also lead to a crash or worse. We have\nnot researched further what kind of malicious actions that potentially this\ncould be used for.\n\nApplications have to explicitly enable cookie parsing in libcurl for this\nproblem to trigger, and if not enabled libcurl will not hit this problem.\n\nWe are not aware of any exploits of this flaw.\n\nAffected versions: from libcurl 7.31.0 to and including 7.41.0\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Daniel Stenberg (curl upstream) for reporting this issue.
