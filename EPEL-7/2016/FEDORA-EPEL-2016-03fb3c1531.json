Sometimes you have to make compromises especially when dealing with a large group of non-technical consumers and you only have very limited free time to support them.\n\nSee also my experiments at https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/games:openra where I even went through the madness of doing so in a cross-distribution way."

versioned and use `cp -a %{SOURCE1} %{name}.chm`\n\n\n* Using pushd / popd is preferred over using cd\n\n\n* Using mkdir -p ist preferred over install -d because you can\n  create several dirs with one invocation.\n\n\n* You can shorten the SourceX-Urls with using %{url} for the\n  common portion.\n\n\n* URL *never* ends on a slash '/'.\n\n\n===== Solution =====\n\n**NOT** approved, fix those severe stuff  and I'll have another run."

The F21 repo hosts 2.27 (2.27-1.fc21), while F22 is at 2.26 (2.26-9.fc21).\n\nkeepass 2.30 has finally successfully built, albeit it only for F23 and F24. Though the releases don't seem to be security fixes, it would be great to have them in F21/F22 as well.\n\nTo build on F22, I needed to patch the SPEC file, because there's a Mono-4.0 specific modification command in there:\n\nhttp://copr-dist-git.fedorainfracloud.org/cgit/barsnick/fed-newer/keepass.git/commit/?id=0627c0c09ce0c3402c68b519a09ca67cb9f85db3\n\nThis is my corresponding copr build:\nhttps://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/barsnick/fed-newer/build/109456/\n\nWorks fine so far for me (basic usage) on x86_64.\n\n(Build fails on ppc64le due to a missing ExcludeArch, but I fail to find a ruling on that in the Mono packaging guidelines.)"

That's my biggest issue...\n\nI am hoping v2.30 works better, menus continue to work properly even when you open other programs and then navigate back to keepass which was already open.\n\nIf you have not tried it... Open keepass, than open Firefox, thunderbird or open the system settings window (basically open a few other programs) and then go back to keepass (which you openned first).  Under the v2.26 (F22) I find that the dropdowns work but you can't click on anything if other programs or windows have been opened after keepass.  Continuing on with keyboard commands works for awhile but that even get's corrupted after a while.\n\nIf keepass v2.26 is the only thing open it seems to work fine... but the irony is it's a password manager so of course we want to be able to use it for things we are doing in other programs...  thus, my biggest problem."

Sometimes you have to make compromises especially when dealing with a large group of non-technical consumers and you only have very limited free time to support them.\n\nSee also my experiments at https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/games:openra where I even went through the madness of doing so in a cross-distribution way."

versioned and use `cp -a %{SOURCE1} %{name}.chm`\n\n\n* Using pushd / popd is preferred over using cd\n\n\n* Using mkdir -p ist preferred over install -d because you can\n  create several dirs with

Do we need a permission to do that, similar as it was for Fedora Rawhide?\n* the nunit package needs to built for Epel, it replaces mono-nunit\n* 2 packages fail to build from source in Rawhide, gdata-sharp (#1296095) and gnome-sharp (#1296105). They are easy to fix.\n* only one package (libgpod) has a %rhel conditional in Rawhide that needs to be fixed\n* the package banshee has one little difference, it requires gnome-desktop3-devel in Epel7 instead of gnome-desktop-devel in Fedora\n* all other packages that depend on Mono can be built from their rawhide/f23 srpm.\n\nI have documented the packages individually here:\nhttps://github.com/tpokorra/mono-epel/wiki\nYou can see the differences of those packages that I needed to modify from Fedora 23 here: https://github.com/tpokorra/mono-epel"
