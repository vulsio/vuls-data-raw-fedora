The option was between upgrading to 0.4.4 (security only fix) and 2.0.0 (security+features update).\n\nHere's is why I proposed an upgrade from 0.4 to 2.0 for F22/23:\n - 0.4 is 5 years old\n - 0.4 branch is for critical security fixes only (not for general bugfixes)\n - Many users are really looking for 2.0 on Fedora (in few hours we had karma +4/0/0 for F23 update)\n - KeePassX is a leaf node, no package depends on it\n - KeePassX has no plugin interface, so no external plugin could be affected\n - 2.0 still uses Qt 4.x (only git master users Qt 5)\n - User experience is usually not affected, if not during migration (ABI/API/user experience changes should be avoided on stable, but it's not a must)\n - Breaking compatibility (even if providing an effective one-way migration) could be an issue, but Firefox updates are not so different (https/websites/extensions/...)\n - Fedora is usually less conservative about updates (features/first)\n\nWhat it could have been improved:\n - Wait for comments about 0.4 vs 2.0 (another week maybe?)\n - Disable autokarma push (so we could had a whole week before pushing to stable?)\n - Ask for FESCo help/comments/suggestions\n\nWhat it looks good to me:\n - spec file was really outdated, with broken links, old macros, non-standard way to do things, and %check section was missing: now it's fine and it doesn't need any custom patch\n - 2.0 and the new spec are working as expected (many positive karma points)\n - Many users are satisfied with this upgrade\n - I made experience and I'm going to be more careful in the future\n\nYour feedback is important, especially in this kind of borderline decisions. Feel free to make your points and give negative karma points if necessary, as we are community and collaboration is critical in order to grew together. Next time this kind thing will happen I'll handle in a better way ;)\n\nBy the way, thank you all for your help."

I can't share a keepassx DB between current and previous releases. Why is this change happening in stable releases, not just in rawhide? Is maintenance actually required, or could the old version have juyst stayed on the F22 and F23 releases without being touched?"

Even upgrading to 0.4.4 could have been criticized.\n\nAs I said before: probably a copr for 2.0.0 F22/F23 and 0.4.4 in stable would have been the best compromise.\n\n> Indeed.

They wil have converted heir databases to version 2 format by the time new update back to 0.4 arrives breaking their databases again. This time they just will not have automatic converter available.
