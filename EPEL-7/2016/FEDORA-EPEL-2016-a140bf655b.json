These functions failed to check for an out-of-range palette when reading or writing PNG files with a bit_depth less than 8. Some applications might read the bit depth from the IHDR chunk and allocate memory for a 2^N entry palette, while libpng can return a palette with up to 256 entries even when the bit depth is less than 8.\n\nAffected versions of libpng are before 1.0.64, 1.1.x and 1.2.x before 1.2.54, 1.3.x and 1.4.x before 1.4.17, 1.5.x before 1.5.24, and 1.6.x before 1.6.19.\n\nUpstream patches:\n\nhttps://github.com/glennrp/libpng/commit/81f44665cce4cb1373f049a76f3904e981b7a766\nhttps://github.com/glennrp/libpng/commit/a901eb3ce6087e0afeef988247f1a1aa208cb54d\nhttps://github.com/glennrp/libpng/commit/1bef8e97995c33123665582e57d3ed40b57d5978\nhttps://github.com/glennrp/libpng/commit/83f4c735c88e7f451541c1528d8043c31ba3b466\nhttps://github.com/glennrp/libpng/commit/9f2ad4928e47036cf1ac9b8fe45a491f15be2324\n\nCVE assignment:\n\nhttp://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q4/264"

That's because we don't think that other CVSSv2 score give an appropriate approximation of the real-life impact of this issue.\n\nIn order to be vulnerable, an application needs to calculate the exact minimum buffer space for the palette according to the image's bit depth and then has to interact with libpng in a way that would copy the palette into the buffer the application has reserved.\n\nThis is an extra-effort step most applications do not take, for simplicity reasons. Instead, for example, a lot of applications use the maximum size the palette can possibly have, regardless of the image's bit depth. In such a case, the application would not be vulnerable, even when using a vulnerable libpng version."
