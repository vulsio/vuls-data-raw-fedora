The index value is then used directly as an index to an array\nin the C code; internally the address of the array and its index are\nadded to each other in order to yield the address of the value that is\ndesired. However, by supplying a negative index value and adding this\nto the address of the array, the processor's register value wraps\naround and the calculated value will point to a position in memory\nwhich isn't within the bounds of the supplied string, causing the\nfunction to access other parts of the process memory.\n...\n\nUpstream bug report with additional technical details:\n[1] http://bugs.python.org/issue21529\n\nUpstream commits (taken from upstream tracker):\n\n2.7: http://hg.python.org/cpython/rev/50c07ed1743d\n3.1: http://hg.python.org/cpython/rev/a8facac493ef\n3.2: http://hg.python.org/cpython/rev/8130b8c06606\n3.3: http://hg.python.org/cpython/rev/4f15bd1ab28f\n3.4: http://hg.python.org/cpython/rev/7b95540ced5c\n3.5: http://hg.python.org/cpython/rev/3a414c709f1f"

								"thetext": "The original report suggests that this is a high severity issue because of \"ubiquity of JSON parsing in Python applications\".  However, practical impact seems rather limited.  To trigger the issue, negative value is passed as idx argument of raw_decode().  However, this argument is not documented in the Python standard library documentation, which currently says:\n\n  raw_decode(s)\n\n    Decode a JSON document from s (a str or unicode beginning with a JSON\n    document) and return a 2-tuple of the Python representation and the index\n    in s where the document ended.\n\n    This can be used to decode a JSON document from a string that may have\n    extraneous data at the end.\n\n  https://docs.python.org/2/library/json.html#json.JSONDecoder.raw_decode\n  https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#json.JSONDecoder.raw_decode\n\nTherefore, the idx argument for the function is rarely used.  I've not been able to identify any application that could pass arbitrary negative value as idx.  The only use of the idx argument uses the following pattern from decode(), which is used to strip leading spaces from the input string:\n\n  WHITESPACE = re.compile(r'\\s*', FLAGS)\n  _w=WHITESPACE.match\n  raw_decode(s, idx=_w(s, 0).end())\n\nThis does not allow passing arbitrary negative index value to raw_decode().\n\nIt should be noted that the json module that is part of Python standard library is based on simplejson, currently using version 2.0.9.  The json module was added to the Python standard library in version 2.6, therefore python packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 (using python 2.4.3) and older are not affected by this issue.  The python packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 (using python 2.6.6) use json module based on simplejson 1.9.  The code affected by this issue was only introduced later, and added to Python standard library as part of this rebase from 1.9 to 2.0.9:\n\nhttp://hg.python.org/cpython/rev/52199\nhttp://bugs.python.org/issue4136\n\nTherefore python packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 are not affected.  There are also python-simplejson packages shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 (version 2.0.9), which are affected by this issue.\n\nRecent upstream versions of simplejson (such as the version used in Red Hat Software Collections 1) also mitigate this issue by not allowing arbitrary negative index in raw_decode().  Starting with version 2.6.1 (based on upstream git repository tags), raw_decode() also performs stripping of leading spaces, which deals with negative index as a side effect:\n\nhttps://github.com/simplejson/simplejson/commit/0fb0aea\n\nHowever, it is possible to reproduce the issue by calling (undocumented) scan_once() function directly.  This problem was reported to simplejson upstream via:\n\nhttps://github.com/simplejson/simplejson/issues/98\n\nFor the sake of completeness, API documentation of current upstream simplejson versions document idx argument for the raw_decode() function:\n\n  raw_decode(s[, idx=0])\n\n    Decode a JSON document from s (a str or unicode beginning with a JSON\n    document) starting from the index idx and return a 2-tuple of the Python\n    representation and the index in s where the document ended.\n\n    This can be used to decode a JSON document from a string that may have\n    extraneous data at the end, or to decode a string that has a series of\n    JSON objects.\n\n    JSONDecodeError will be raised if the given JSON document is not valid.\n\n  http://simplejson.readthedocs.org/en/latest/#simplejson.JSONDecoder.raw_decode"
