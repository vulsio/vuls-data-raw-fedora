Only after really stopping and starting httpd (instead of reloading) the new certificate was detected and I was able to get updated versions of calendar and contacts. Enabling the older contacts and calendar applications made owncloud completely non-functional. I had to move the contacts and calendar folder manually away and disable those application on the commandline. It was also necessary to run the occ upgrade command three times. Once after the owncloud upgrade. Once after contacts enablement and once after calendar enablement. So the core update worked without problems but not the upgrade of especially those two applications (calendar and contacts).",

This means that some of the features like mounting external storage, notifications about updates or installation of third-party apps will not work.

The new build also runs the owncloud application in it's own owncloud pool in php-fpm rather than sharing the default www one... so again if using nginx please carefully verify your configs.\n\nSee bz1332900 or bz1332901 for details\n\nThe dependencies included are from private- branches that Remi and Shawn have for upcoming versions of php-sabre and php-symfony. The major blocker now for the 9.0.2 release is symfony 2.8, which is being worked on at present.\n\nI have run these through my test matrix for fresh install and upgrades from 8.2 on F24 and EL7 but please keep in mind the preliminary build warning and that the newer dependencies not in Fedora/EPEL yet are just a local mock build from the private- branches.\n\nThe ansible roles used to test these can be found here:\n\nhttps://github.com/hogarthj/test_vms\n\nFor those interested an article on building and testing this stuff is due to go up on my blog in the coming week ;)\n\nThe spec used for these has been pushed to the private-owncloud-next branch as well."
