Only CloudForms 5.8, which is now EOL, delivered the python-ecdsa library.\n\nCurrent releases of Red Hat Virtualization Manager no longer include python-ecdsa as a dependency.  While it remains available in repositories as a legacy dependency, it is not installed by default and its use is not recommended.\n\nCurrent releases of Red Hat Satellite no longer include python-ecdsa as a dependency.
