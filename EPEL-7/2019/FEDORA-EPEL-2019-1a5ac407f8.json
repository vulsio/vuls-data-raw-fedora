selected component (if applicable):\n\n3.03\n\nHow reproducible:\n\n\nThere are three poc files: \nhttps://github.com/zjuchenyuan/fuzzpoc/raw/master/jhead_poc1\nhttps://github.com/zjuchenyuan/fuzzpoc/raw/master/jhead_poc2\nhttps://github.com/zjuchenyuan/fuzzpoc/raw/master/jhead_poc3\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. wget https://github.com/zjuchenyuan/fuzzpoc/raw/master/jhead_poc{1..3}\n2. jhead jhead_poc1\n\nReproducible docker image based on ubuntu16.04 has been pushed to `zjuchenyuan/dockerized_poc:jhead`, you can do these:\n\n```\ndocker run -it --rm zjuchenyuan/dockerized_poc:jhead\n# in the container\n/tmp/asan/jhead /fuzzpoc/jhead_poc1\nvalgrind -v /tmp/justafl/jhead /fuzzpoc/jhead_poc1\n```\n\nActual results: (after removing useless lines)\n\n\n```\nStep 5/10 : RUN /tmp/asan/jhead /fuzzpoc/jhead_poc1 || exit 0\n ---> Running in
