EAP-pwd uses a similar design for deriving PWE from the password and while a specific attack against EAP-pwd is not yet known to be tested, there is no reason to believe that the EAP-pwd implementation would be immune against the type of cache attack that was identified for the SAE implementation. Since the EAP-pwd implementation in hostapd (EAP server) and wpa_supplicant (EAP peer) does not support MODP groups, the timing attack described against SAE is not applicable for the EAP-pwd implementation.\n\n\nReferences:\nhttps://wpa3.mathyvanhoef.com/\nhttps://w1.fi/security/2019-2/eap-pwd-side-channel-attack.txt\n\n\nUpstream Patch:\nhttps://w1.fi/cgit/hostap/commit/?id=d42c477cc794163a3757956bbffca5cea000923c\nhttps://w1.fi/cgit/hostap/commit/?id=6e34f618d37ddbb5854c42e2ad4fca83492fa7b7\nhttps://w1.fi/cgit/hostap/commit/?id=c93461c1d98f52681717a088776ab32fd97872b0\nhttps://w1.fi/cgit/hostap/commit/?id=aaf65feac67c3993935634eefe5bc76b9fce03aa"
