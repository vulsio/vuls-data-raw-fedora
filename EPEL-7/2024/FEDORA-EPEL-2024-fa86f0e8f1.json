ScreamTracker 2 only outputs mono sound.\n  - PSM: File header probing was stricter than actual file loader, rejecting manipulated files that would otherwise load fine.\n\n\n# libopenmpt 0.7.7 (2024-05-12)\n\n  - [Bug] `examples/libopenmpt_example_c_pipe.c` and `libopenmpt/bindings/freebasic/libopenmpt_ext.bi` were missing from the Autotools package.\n  - [New] New Makefile `CONFIG=mingw-w64` option `WINDOWS_CRT=[crtdll,msvcrt,ucrt]` to select the toolchain CRT library.\n  - [Change] `build/download_externals.sh` now verifies the integrity of any downloaded files and uses curl instead of wget.\n  - [Regression] Optimization level when compiling with GCC 14 has been forced down to `-O1` due to the severe miscompilation GCC 14 has shown on MinGW-w64 amd64 (see https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=115049).\n  - IT: Disable a few more compatibility flags for older SchismTracker builds.\n  - IT: Halve the output volume of files saved with ChibiTracker, as its mixer is about half as loud as ours.\n  - S3M: In mono mode, the ratio between sample and OPL volume was incorrect.\n  - S3M: Detect files saved with PlayerPRO.\n  - XM: Detect files saved with PlayerPRO. Improved detection of files saved with ModPlug Tracker.\n  - XM: Files with impossibly small pattern headers are now rejected, like FastTracker 2 does.\n  - STK: Loosen SoundTracker file rejection heuristics a bit to allow loading of files with malformed song titles and overly long samples. Other heuristics has been tightened a bit.\n  - MOD: Change VBlank timing heuristic to always assume CIA timing when long samples unsupported by original ProTracker) are found.\n  - MOD: Disable NoiseTracker quirks if empty sample slots have a default volume other than 0.\n  - MOD: 7-bit panning detection may have returned incorrect results for MODs with a channel count other than 4.\n  - MED: Improve handling of default tempo, panning and channel volume in files containing more than one song.\n  - MO3: Reduced maximum allowed music data (not samples) size from 2 GiB to 512 MiB.\n  - XMF: Header validation is now stricter.\n  - MDL: Slightly more accurate import of pattern command 9 (enabling envelopes instead of setting envelope position).\n  - ULT: Support the highest three octaves.\n  - OPL emulation could produce clicks when using a mix rate higher than 65536 Hz.\n  - xmp-openmpt: Subsongs whose length could not be calculate no longer show a duration of -12:-55.\n  - mpg123: Update to v1.32.6 (2024-04-04).",
