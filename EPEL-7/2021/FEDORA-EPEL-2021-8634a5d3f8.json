						"text": "ah, no, it didn't 'go away', because the -1.fc35 builds are now in stable for f33, f34 and f35. So we still have -1.fc35 and -2.fc35 both available when the test runs, and dnf picks -1.fc35 over -2.fc35.\n\nAnother thing I can do is rebuild the openQA base disk images to include -1.fc35, so that's where we start out, and see if the update from there to -2.fc35 works. This is just papering over the issue, but I guess it'd be kinda acceptable, because it would mean the 'real world' consequence would only be that if both are available when a system updates from an older version, it will first go to -1.fc35, then -2.fc35, which isn't so bad. I'll try that.",

These vulnerabilities were confirmed and resolved. To our knowledge, these vulnerabilities have not been exploited.\n\nThese vulnerabilities may allow an attacker using a maliciously crafted NTFS-formatted image file or external storage to potentially execute arbitrary privileged code, if the attacker has either local access and the ntfs-3g binary is setuid root, or if the attacker has physical access to an external port to a computer which is configured to run the ntfs-3g binary or one of the ntfsprogs tools when the external storage is plugged into the computer. These vulnerabilities result from incorrect validation of some of the NTFS metadata that could potentially cause buffer overflows, which could be exploited by an attacker. Common ways for attackers to gain physical access to a machine is through social engineering or an evil maid attack on an unattended computer.\n\nWe recommend installing and applying the update with the security fixes, and advise to follow security guidance and frameworks such as NIST for assessing and improving an organization’s abilities to prevent, detect, and respond to security threats and cyber attacks.\n\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS: All previous versions of open source NTFS-3G and NTFSPROGS.\n\nWORKAROUND: None\n\nSOLUTION: Upgrade to 2021.8.22\n\nPROJECT URL: https://github.com/tuxera/ntfs-3g\n\nADVISORY ID: NTFS3G-SA-2021-0001\n\nISSUE DATE: 2021-08-30\n\nSEVERITY: Moderate\n\nCVEs: CVE-2021-33285, CVE-2021-35269, CVE-2021-35268, CVE-2021-33289, CVE-2021-33286, CVE-2021-35266, CVE-2021-33287, CVE-2021-35267, CVE-2021-39251, CVE-2021-39252, CVE-2021-39253, CVE-2021-39254, CVE-2021-39255, CVE-2021-39256, CVE-2021-39257, CVE-2021-39258, CVE-2021-39259, CVE-2021-39260, CVE-2021-39261, CVE-2021-39262, CVE-2021-39263\n\nCVSS SCORE: 3.9-6.7\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENT: Jeremy Galindo, Akshay Ajayan, Kyle Zeng and Fish Wang for reporting these vulnerabilities.\n```"

To our knowledge, these vulnerabilities have not been exploited.\n\nThese vulnerabilities may allow an attacker using a maliciously crafted NTFS-formatted image file or external storage to potentially execute arbitrary privileged code, if the attacker has either local access and the ntfs-3g binary is setuid root, or if the attacker has physical access to an external port to a computer which is configured to run the ntfs-3g binary or one of the ntfsprogs tools when the external storage is plugged into the computer. These vulnerabilities result from incorrect validation of some of the NTFS metadata that could potentially cause buffer overflows, which could be exploited by an attacker. Common ways for attackers to gain physical access to a machine is through social engineering or an evil maid attack on an unattended computer.\n\nWe recommend installing and applying the update with the security fixes, and advise to follow security guidance and frameworks such as NIST for assessing and improving an organization’s abilities to prevent, detect, and respond to security threats and cyber attacks.\n\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS: All previous versions of open source NTFS-3G and NTFSPROGS.\n\nWORKAROUND: None\n\nSOLUTION: Upgrade to 2021.8.22\n\nPROJECT URL: https://github.com/tuxera/ntfs-3g\n\nADVISORY ID: NTFS3G-SA-2021-0001\n\nISSUE DATE: 2021-08-30\n\nSEVERITY: Moderate\n\nCVEs: CVE-2021-33285, CVE-2021-35269, CVE-2021-35268, CVE-2021-33289, CVE-2021-33286, CVE-2021-35266, CVE-2021-33287, CVE-2021-35267, CVE-2021-39251, CVE-2021-39252, CVE-2021-39253, CVE-2021-39254, CVE-2021-39255, CVE-2021-39256, CVE-2021-39257, CVE-2021-39258, CVE-2021-39259, CVE-2021-39260, CVE-2021-39261, CVE-2021-39262, CVE-2021-39263\n\nCVSS SCORE: 3.9-6.7\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENT: Jeremy Galindo, Akshay Ajayan, Kyle Zeng and Fish Wang for reporting these vulnerabilities.\n```"
