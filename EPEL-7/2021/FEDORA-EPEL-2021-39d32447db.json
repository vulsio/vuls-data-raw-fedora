IPv6 public addresses AFAIK are assigned by IT and the\nsystems will fetch it with dhcpv6. But link-local addresses can be auto-generated\nand doesn't depend on anything, so we may have two problems at hand here then.\n\nSo it would be helpful if you could describe how the network is configured on these\nsystems. Is it using networkmanager? Is it, somehow, disabling ipv6 maybe (say, via\nnet.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6)?\n\n(In reply to Hubert Kario from comment #0)\n> Actual results:\n> LISTEN     0      128          0.0.0.0:4433       0.0.0.0:*   \n> users:((\"openssl\",pid=7325,fd=3))\n> \n> Expected results:\n> LISTEN      0        128                     *:4433                   *:*   \n> users:((\"openssl\",pid=846593,fd=3)) \n\nFor this, it shouldn't matter specifics of cabled interfaces, as you can have ipv6\nenabled only on loopback and it should be enough. Can you please share the output of\n'ip addr list' ?"

This may subsequently result in a NULL pointer deref and a crash leading to a potential denial of service attack. The function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() is never directly called by OpenSSL itself so applications are only vulnerable if they use this function directly and they use it on certificates that may have been obtained from untrusted sources. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1i and below are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1j. OpenSSL versions 1.0.2x and below are affected by this issue. However OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. Premium support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade to 1.0.2y. Other users should upgrade to 1.1.1j.

This may subsequently result in a NULL pointer deref and a crash leading to a potential denial of service attack.

However, if the patch is reverted, it has an effect on the \"ssl_reject_handshake\" feature in nginx. Although, this feature will continue to work, TLS 1.3 protocol becomes unavailable/disabled. This is already known - https://trac.nginx.org/nginx/ticket/2071#comment:1 and as per https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/16075#issuecomment-879939938, nginx could early callback instead of servername callback.
