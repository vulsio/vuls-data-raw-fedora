For you problem, you should use an override systemd file (created with systemctl edit) instead of editing the service file directly. You could probably deliver your override file directly too in the /etc/systemd/system/<service>.d directory if you need to automate this change. See https://cubethethird.wordpress.com/2018/01/14/how-to-edit-systemd-unit-files-services/ for help."
