This can also happen by\nusing the ASN1_STRING_set0() function.\n\nNumerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to assume that\nthe ASN1_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not\nguaranteed for strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application\nrequests an ASN.1 structure to be printed, and where that ASN.1 structure\ncontains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the application\nwithout NUL terminating the \"data\" field, then a read buffer overrun can occur.\n\nThe same thing can also occur during name constraints processing of certificates\n(for example if a certificate has been directly constructed by the application\ninstead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and the certificate\ncontains non NUL terminated ASN1_STRING structures).

It could also result in the disclosure of private memory\ncontents (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext).\n\nOpenSSL versions 1.1.1k and below are affected by this issue.
