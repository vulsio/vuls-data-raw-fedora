Afterwards,\nmacho_parse_file() will be called with buffer and size values that\ncould be invalid, resulting in arbitrary read and plausible infoleakage or a\ndenial of service.\n\nProof of Concept\n----------------\nParse the\nhttps://github.com/x41sec/advisories/tree/master/X41-2021-001/yara-reproducers/int-overflow-macho-parse-fat-file\nsample via yr_rules_scan_mem().\n\n\nOut-of-bounds reads in macho_parse_file() and others\n====================================================\nSeverity Rating: Medium\nVector: Mach-O file sample\nCVE: Pending\nCWE: 125\n\n\nAnalysis\n--------\nTwo for-loops iterate over input buffer data to extract and process\nsegments and other commands. Incorrect sanity checks lead to out of\nbounds reads in several places.\n\nIt is also recommended to perform a sanity check on\ncommand_struct.cmdsize, discarding those values where\ncommand_struct.cmdsize<sizeof(yr_load_command_t).\n\n   for (unsigned i = 0; i < header.ncmds; i++)\n   {\n- -    if (command - data < sizeof(yr_load_command_t))\n+    if (data + size < command + sizeof(yr_load_command_t))\n       break;\n\n     memcpy(&command_struct, command, sizeof(yr_load_command_t));\n\n    if (should_swap)\n      swap_load_command(&command_struct);\n\n- -    if (size < header_size + command_struct.cmdsize)\n+    if (size - (command - data) < command_struct.cmdsize ||\ncommand_struct.cmdsize < sizeof(yr_load_command_t))\n       break;\n\nPlease note that this needs to be patched in the two similar for-loops.\n\n\nProof of Concept\n----------------\nParse the\nhttps://github.com/x41sec/advisories/tree/master/X41-2021-001/yara-reproducers/oob-macho-parse-file\nsample via yr_rules_scan_mem().\n\n\nOut-of-bounds reads in macho_handle_segment_64() and others\n===========================================================\nSeverity Rating: Medium\nVector: Mach-O file sample\nCVE: Pending\nCWE: 125\n\n\nAnalysis\n--------\nmacho_handle_segment_64() reads sizeof(yr_segment_command_64_t) bytes\nfrom command without checking if the buffer is big enough.\n\n  memcpy(&sg, command, sizeof(yr_segment_command_64_t));\n\nThis results in an out of bounds read when command is not big enough.\nInfoleak\nor denial of service could be a plausible outcome.\n\nIt is recommended to check at least sizeof(yr_segment_command_64_t)\nbytes are available in command before calling macho_handle_segment64().\n\nThe same issue occurs when calling macho_handle_segment(),\nmacho_handle_unixthread() and macho_handle_main().\n\n{\n     case LC_SEGMENT:\n+      if(command_struct.cmdsize < sizeof(yr_segment_command_32_t))\n+        break;\n       macho_handle_segment(command, seg_count++, object);\n       break;\n     case LC_SEGMENT_64:\n+      if(command_struct.cmdsize < sizeof(yr_segment_command_64_t))\n+        break;\n       macho_handle_segment_64(command, seg_count++, object);\n       break;\n}\n\n{\n    case LC_UNIXTHREAD:\n+     if(command_struct.cmdsize < sizeof(yr_thread_command_t))\n+         break;\n      macho_handle_unixthread(command, object, context);\n      break;\n    case LC_MAIN:\n+     if(command_struct.cmdsize < sizeof(yr_entry_point_command_t))\n+         break;\n      macho_handle_main(command, object, context);\n      break;\n    }\n\n}\n\nPlease note that we rely here on cmdsize having a safe value, which is\nchecked in the fix proposed for the previous finding.\n\n\nProof of Concept\n----------------\nParse the\nhttps://github.com/x41sec/advisories/tree/master/X41-2021-001/yara-reproducers/oob-macho-handle-segment,\nhttps://github.com/x41sec/advisories/tree/master/X41-2021-001/yara-reproducers/oob-macho-handle-segment-64\nsamples via yr_rules_scan_mem().\n\n\nSeveral out-of-bounds reads in macho_handle_unixthread()\n========================================================\nSeverity Rating: Medium\nVector: Mach-O file sample\nCVE: Pending\nCWE: 125\n\n\nAnalysis\n--------\nmacho_handle_unixthread() reads from command buffer without checking if\nthe buffer is big enough.\n\nFirstly, sizeof(yr_thread_command_t) bytes are skipped in command,\n\n  command = (void*) ((uint8_t*) command + sizeof(yr_thread_command_t));\n\nwhich could result in command pointing out of bounds and triggering\ninvalid reads in subsequent command dereferences. It is recommended\nto check at least sizeof(yr_thread_command_t) bytes are available\nbefore calling macho_handle_unixthread().\n\n    case LC_UNIXTHREAD:\n+     if(size - (command - data) < sizeof(yr_thread_command_t))\n+         break;\n      macho_handle_unixthread(command, object, context);\n      break;\n\nSecondly, when reading the entry point for the different architectures,\nit is\nassumed the buffer is big enough to read the corresponding\nyr_*_thread_state_t object. A not big enough buffer would lead to out\nof bounds reads and maybe denial of service or infoleaks.
