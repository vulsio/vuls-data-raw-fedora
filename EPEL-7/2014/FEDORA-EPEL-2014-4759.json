						"thetext": "+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #1059028 +++\n\nThis still appears to be a problem in the EPEL version of rabbitmq-server.\n\nDescription of problem:\n\nI originally encountered this issue when installing OpenStack via devstack but have since been able to reproduce it by simply executing commands inside of a fresh F20 install.\n\nVersion-Release number of selected component (if applicable):\n\nrabbitmq-server-3.1.5-1.fc20.noarch\n\nHow reproducible:\n\nOccurs regularly but not 100% of the time\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\n/sbin/service rabbitmq-server stop\n/sbin/service rabbitmq-server start\nrabbitmqctl change_password guest newpassword\n\n\nActual results:\n\nAbout half the time, on a freshly installed F20, this will fail, claiming the node cannot be contacted.  A typical error message:\n\n[root@cob-dell5 ~]# rabbitmqctl change_password guest ozrootpw\nChanging password for user \"guest\" ...\nError: unable to connect to node 'rabbit@cob-dell5': nodedown\n\nDIAGNOSTICS\n===========\n\nnodes in question: ['rabbit@cob-dell5']\n\nhosts, their running nodes and ports:\n- cob-dell5: [{rabbitmqctl2648,48609}]\n\ncurrent node details:\n- node name: 'rabbitmqctl2648@cob-dell5'\n- home dir: /var/lib/rabbitmq\n- cookie hash: 8DNoVu56TqDYWypW7YXDJw==\n\nExpected results:\n\nChanging password for user \"guest\" ...\n...done.\n\n--- Additional comment from Ian McLeod on 2014-01-28 21:36:45 EST ---\n\nSee the following thread on rdo-list for another example of this issue:\n\nhttps://www.redhat.com/archives/rdo-list/2013-December/msg00058.html\n\nAs well as this more recent one, indicating tha the problem persists:\n\nhttps://www.redhat.com/archives/rdo-list/2014-January/msg00164.html\n\n--- Additional comment from Ian McLeod on 2014-02-27 17:51:21 EST ---\n\nNote to anyone following.  The devstack installer has a commit that attempts to workaround this issue by retrying the rabbitmq restart:\n\nhttps://github.com/openstack-dev/devstack/commit/f6c001faf6ac5728e07c6bbdaa67680395ed6f48\n\nStill, it would be nice to sort this out on the rabbitmq side eventually.\n\n--- Additional comment from Fedora Admin XMLRPC Client on 2014-07-01 13:58:36 EDT ---\n\nThis package has changed ownership in the Fedora Package Database.  Reassigning to the new owner of this component.\n\n--- Additional comment from Fedora Update System on 2014-08-10 04:14:16 EDT ---\n\nrabbitmq-server-3.1.5-9.fc20 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 20.\nhttps://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/rabbitmq-server-3.1.5-9.fc20\n\n--- Additional comment from lnie on 2014-08-11 03:00:36 EDT ---\n\nrabbitmq-server-3.1.5-9.fc20 works\n\n--- Additional comment from Fedora Update System on 2014-08-14 22:35:38 EDT ---\n\nPackage rabbitmq-server-3.1.5-9.fc20:\n* should fix your issue,\n* was pushed to the Fedora 20 testing repository,\n* should be available at your local mirror within two days.\nUpdate it with:\n# su -c 'yum update --enablerepo=updates-testing rabbitmq-server-3.1.5-9.fc20'\nas soon as you are able to.\nPlease go to the following url:\nhttps://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2014-9337/rabbitmq-server-3.1.5-9.fc20\nthen log in and leave karma (feedback).\n\n--- Additional comment from Fedora Update System on 2014-08-15 20:28:02 EDT ---\n\nrabbitmq-server-3.1.5-9.fc20 has been pushed to the Fedora 20 stable repository.
