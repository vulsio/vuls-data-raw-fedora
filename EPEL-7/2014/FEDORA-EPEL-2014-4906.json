								"thetext": "This issue can affect applications using curl if they enabled cookie support and are used to access HTTP/HTTPS servers using IP address rather than host name.  To take advantage of the problem, attacker needs to trick victim into connecting to their malicious server using its IP address.  The IP of the malicious server must have the last two or three octets of it match relevant octets of a non-malicious server IP victim normally connects to (i.e. using example from comment 0, if victim normally connects to 192.168.0.1, attack's malicious server must use an IP ending with 168.0.1 or 0.1).  In such case, attacker's server can send cookies with crafted 'domain' attribute that will be sent to the target server.\n\nThis can provide an attacker with a way to exploit other cookie handling bugs on the target server (e.g. session fixation issues, or other issues related to improper sanitization of cookie values).\n\nIt does not seem this issue can lead to leak of cookies in any reasonable use case.  A non-malicious server would have to incorrectly set 'domain' attributes on cookies it returns to risk their expose to other servers."

To take advantage of the problem, attacker needs to trick victim into connecting to their malicious server using its IP address.  The IP of the malicious server must have the last two or three octets of it match relevant octets of a non-malicious server IP victim normally connects to (i.e. using example from comment 0, if victim normally connects to 192.168.0.1, attack's malicious server must use an IP ending with 168.0.1 or 0.1).  In such case, attacker's server can send cookies with crafted 'domain' attribute that will be sent to the target server.\n\nThis can provide an attacker with a way to exploit other cookie handling bugs on the target server (e.g. session fixation issues, or other issues related to improper sanitization of cookie values).\n\nIt does not seem this issue can lead to leak of cookies in any reasonable use case.  A non-malicious server would have to incorrectly set 'domain' attributes on cookies it returns to risk their expose to other servers."

								"thetext": "Daniel Stenberg reported the following vulnerability in cURL:\n\n\"\"\nlibcurl's function curl_easy_duphandle() has a bug that can lead to libcurl\neventually sending off sensitive data that was not intended for sending.\n\nWhen doing an HTTP POST transfer with libcurl, you can use the\n`CURLOPT_COPYPOSTFIELDS` option to specify a memory area holding the data to\nsend to the remote server. The memory area's size is set with a separate\noption, for example `CURLOPT_POSTFIELDSIZE`.\n\nAs the name implies, the data in the specified buffer is copied to a privately\nheld memory buffer that libcurl allocates on the heap. The memory area is\nassociated with the common CURL handle, often referred to as an \"easy handle\".\n\nThis handle can be duplicated by an application to create an identical copy,\nand all the already set options and data is then also similarly cloned and\nwill be associated with the newly returned handle. This also includes the data\nto send in an HTTP POST request.\n\nThe internal libcurl function that duplicates options from the old handle to\nthe new had two problems:\n\n1. It mistakenly treated the post data buffer as if it was a C string. A C\n   string ends with a zero byte, and subsequently strdup() was used to\n   duplicate the post data buffer. A post data buffer can perfectly\n   legitimately contain a zero byte, or it may not contain any zero byte at\n   all (including no trailing one) - leading to strdup() either making a too\n   small duplicate, a too large one or crash due to reading an inaccessible\n   memory area. The strdup() of course allocates memory off the heap.\n\n2. After duplication of the handle data, the pointer used to read from when\n   sending the data was not updated. So when sending off the post, libcurl\n   would still read from the original handle's buffer which at that time could\n   have been freed or reused for other purposes.\n\nWhen libcurl subsequently constructs the HTTP POST request and includes data\nfor the protocol body it will memcpy() data from that pointer using the old\nsize and the old pointer. This makes a read from the wrong place and can lead\nto libcurl inserting data into the request that happens to be stored at that\nplaces in memory at that time.\n\nWe are not aware of anyone having been able to actually exploit this for\nnefarious purposes, but we can't exclude that it is possible or even might\nalready have been exploited.\n\nINFO\n----\n\nThis bug requires `CURLOPT_COPYPOSTFIELDS` and `curl_easy_duphandle()` to be\nused in that order, and then the duplicate handle must be used to perform the\nHTTP POST.\n\nThe curl tool is not affected, it does not use this sequence.\n\"\"\"\n\nThis issue affects versions 7.17.1 up to and including 7.38.0. It has been fixed in version 7.39.0\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the cURL project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Symeon Paraschoudis as the original reporter."

The out of bounds access occurs in strdup()/strlen().  This can cause crash if unmapped memory is reached before NUL byte is found, but such crash is unlikely.\n\nDue to another bug in the handle duplication code, POST data in the copied handle is not used even if no new POST data are set before performing the request.  Instead, data from the buffer associated with the original handle is used.  Therefore, if the original handle is freed, or if new POST data is set on it between duplication and the use of the new handle, libcurl may use data from an already freed buffer.\n\nThere are no applications in Red Hat Enterprise Linux that uses libcurl in the way that would make them vulnerable to this issue.  The CURLOPT_COPYPOSTFIELDS option is only used by PHP, when PHP script sets CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS option with data that is not array or object.  As string arguments used with PHP curl_setopt(CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS) are unlikely to be NUL terminated, strdup() out of bounds read is likely to happen in curl_copy_handle().\n\nUpstream advisory lists curl versions 7.17.1 and later to be affected by this problem.  The version 7.17.1 is the one that introduced the CURLOPT_COPYPOSTFIELDS option.  The curl packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and earlier are based on older upstream curl versions and hence were not affected by this issue."

The memory area's size is set with a separate\noption, for example `CURLOPT_POSTFIELDSIZE`.\n\nAs the name implies, the data in the specified buffer is copied to a privately\nheld memory buffer that libcurl allocates on the heap. The memory area is\nassociated with the common CURL handle, often referred to as an \"easy handle\".\n\nThis handle can be duplicated by an application to create an identical copy,\nand all the already set options and data is then also similarly cloned and\nwill be associated with the newly returned handle. This also includes the data\nto send in an HTTP POST request.\n\nThe internal libcurl function that duplicates options from the old handle to\nthe new had two problems:\n\n1. It mistakenly treated the post data buffer as if it was a C string. A C\n   string ends with a zero byte, and subsequently strdup() was used to\n   duplicate the post data buffer. A post data buffer can perfectly\n   legitimately contain a zero byte, or it may not contain any zero byte at\n   all (including no trailing one) - leading to strdup() either making a too\n   small duplicate, a too large one or crash due to reading an inaccessible\n   memory area. The strdup() of course allocates memory off the heap.\n\n2. After duplication of the handle data, the pointer used to read from when\n   sending the data was not updated. So when sending off the post, libcurl\n   would still read from the original handle's buffer which at that time could\n   have been freed or reused for other purposes.\n\nWhen libcurl subsequently constructs the HTTP POST request and includes data\nfor the protocol body it will memcpy() data from that pointer using the old\nsize and the old pointer.
