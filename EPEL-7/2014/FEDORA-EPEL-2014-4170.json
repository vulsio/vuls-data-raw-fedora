Applying the patch helped him, so I figured it might also be needed for EPEL.\n\nI did quite a lot of testing on CentOS6, but I was unable to reproduce that problem. If there is a problem, it might affect EPEL7 because it is packaged differently. There's a separate clamav-lib in EPEL7 (and Fedora), but not in EPEL5/6.\n\nI'll do more testing in CentOS7 tomorrow, it's middle of the night in my timezone now."

This issue was identified by Kurt Siefried of Red Hat. \r\n  * Security fix for ClamAV crash when scanning maliciously crafted yoda's crypter files. This issue, as well as several other bugs fixed in this release, were identified by Damien Millescamp of Oppida.\r\n  * ClamAV 0.98.5 now works with OpenSSL in FIPS compliant mode. Thanks to Reinhard Max for supplying the patch.\r\n  * Bug fixes and other feature enhancements.\r\n\r\nPlease see the ChangeLog file or GIT log for further details.",
