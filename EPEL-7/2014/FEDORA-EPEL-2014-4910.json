								"thetext": "Alban Crequy of Collabora Ltd. discovered a denial of service flaw in dbus-daemon.  If a client (C1) was prohibited from sending a message to a service (S1), and S1 was not currently running, then C1 could attempt to send a message to S1's well-known bus name, causing dbus-daemon to start S1.  When S1 had started and obtained its well-known bus name, the dbus-daemon evaluated its security policy, decided that it would not deliver the message to S1, and constructed an AccessDenied error.  Instead of sending that AccessDenied error reply to C1 as a reply to the denied message, dbus-daemon incorrectly sent it to S1 as a reply to the request to obtain its well-known bus name.  This would cause S1 to fail to initialize and exit, denying service to other legitimate clients of S1.\n\nAs well, this opens up the possibility of a side channel where, in an environment where C1 and S1 are untrusted and were administratively prohibited from communicating, S1 could use these incorrectly-directed error messages as a side channel to receive information from C1.  This scenario is only really relevant on systems where an LSM such as SELinux was used in a highly restrictive configuration, because in practice a system bus could typically communicate in other ways (such as non-D-Bus IPC mechanisms, files in /tmp, etc.).\n\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nRed Hat would like to thank D-Bus upstream for reporting this issue.  Upstream acknowledges Alban Crequy of Collabora Ltd. as the original reporter."

Preventing that attack\nrequires raising the system dbus-daemon's RLIMIT_NOFILE (ulimit -n) to a\nhigher value.\n\nTo avoid propagating that higher limit to activatable system services,\nit is desirable to start the system dbus-daemon as root so it can store\nits previous limit, raise its limit, drop root privileges (which its\ndefault configuration will do automatically), and restore the previous\nlimit before launching activatable services. Some operating system\ndistributions, such as anything using the upstream-supplied systemd\nunits, start the system dbus-daemon as root already; others, such as\nDebian 7, currently start the system dbus-daemon under its less\nprivileged uid and will need minor modifications to their init scripts.\n\nSuggested patches are attached. Patch 0001 is not strictly required, but\nif it is skipped, it will be necessary to replace each occurrence of\nDBUS_SYSTEM_LOG_WARNING with DBUS_SYSTEM_LOG_INFO in patch 0002.\n\nAttack details (repeating CVE-2014-3636 part A):\n\nBy queuing up the maximum allowed number of fds, a malicious sender\ncould reach the system dbus-daemon's RLIMIT_NOFILE (ulimit -n, typically\n1024 on Linux). This would act as a denial of service in two ways:\n\n* new clients would be unable to connect to the dbus-daemon\n* when receiving a subsequent message from a non-malicious client that\n  contained a fd, dbus-daemon would receive the MSG_CTRUNC flag,\n  indicating that the list of fds was truncated; kernel fd-passing APIs\n  do not provide any way to recover from that, so dbus-daemon responds\n  to MSG_CTRUNC by disconnecting the sender, causing denial of service\n  to that sender"

								"thetext": "The patch issued by the D-Bus maintainers for CVE-2014-3636 was based on\nincorrect reasoning, and does not fully prevent the attack described as\n\"CVE-2014-3636 part A\", which is repeated below. Preventing that attack\nrequires raising the system dbus-daemon's RLIMIT_NOFILE (ulimit -n) to a\nhigher value.\n\nTo avoid propagating that higher limit to activatable system services,\nit is desirable to start the system dbus-daemon as root so it can store\nits previous limit, raise its limit, drop root privileges (which its\ndefault configuration will do automatically), and restore the previous\nlimit before launching activatable services. Some operating system\ndistributions, such as anything using the upstream-supplied systemd\nunits, start the system dbus-daemon as root already; others, such as\nDebian 7, currently start the system dbus-daemon under its less\nprivileged uid and will need minor modifications to their init scripts.\n\nSuggested patches are attached. Patch 0001 is not strictly required, but\nif it is skipped, it will be necessary to replace each occurrence of\nDBUS_SYSTEM_LOG_WARNING with DBUS_SYSTEM_LOG_INFO in patch 0002.\n\nAttack details (repeating CVE-2014-3636 part A):\n\nBy queuing up the maximum allowed number of fds, a malicious sender\ncould reach the system dbus-daemon's RLIMIT_NOFILE (ulimit -n, typically\n1024 on Linux). This would act as a denial of service in two ways:\n\n* new clients would be unable to connect to the dbus-daemon\n* when receiving a subsequent message from a non-malicious client that\n  contained a fd, dbus-daemon would receive the MSG_CTRUNC flag,\n  indicating that the list of fds was truncated; kernel fd-passing APIs\n  do not provide any way to recover from that, so dbus-daemon responds\n  to MSG_CTRUNC by disconnecting the sender, causing denial of service\n  to that sender"
