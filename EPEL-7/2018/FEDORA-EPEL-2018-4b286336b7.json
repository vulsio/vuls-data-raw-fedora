The tinc 1.1pre versions are not affected by this.\n\nCVE-2018-16738: Michael Yonli discovered that tinc versions 1.0.30 to 1.0.34 allow an oracle attack, similar to CVE-2018-16737, but due to the mitigations put in place for the Sweet32 attack in tinc 1.0.30, it now requires a timing attack that has only a limited time to complete. Tinc 1.1pre16 and earlier are also affected if there are nodes on the same VPN that still use the legacy protocol from tinc version 1.0.x.\n\nCVE-2018-16737: Michael Yonli discovered that tinc 1.0.29 and earlier allow an oracle attack that could allow a remote attacker to establish one-way communication with a tinc node, allowing it to send fake control messages and inject packets into the VPN. The attack takes only a few seconds to complete. Tinc 1.1pre14 and earlier allow the same attack if they are configured to allow connections from nodes using the legacy 1.0.x protocol.\n\nReferences:\n\nhttp://www.tinc-vpn.org/security/"
