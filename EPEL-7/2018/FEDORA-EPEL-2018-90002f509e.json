This allows an attacker in position of man-in-the-middle to alter the content of records by issuing a valid signature for the crafted records. This issue has been assigned CVE-2017-15090.\n\nhttps://doc.powerdns.com/recursor/security-advisories/powerdns-advisory-2017-03.html\n\nCVE-2017-15092\n\nAn issue has been found in the web interface of PowerDNS Recursor, where the qname of DNS queries was displayed without any escaping, allowing a remote attacker to inject HTML and Javascript code into the web interface, altering the content. This issue has been assigned CVE-2017-15092.\n\nhttps://doc.powerdns.com/recursor/security-advisories/powerdns-advisory-2017-05.html\n\nCVE-2017-15093\n\nAn issue has been found in the API of PowerDNS Recursor during a source code audit by Nixu. When api-config-dir is set to a non-empty value, which is not the case by default, the API allows an authorized user to update the Recursor’s ACL by adding and removing netmasks, and to configure forward zones. It was discovered that the new netmask and IP addresses of forwarded zones were not sufficiently validated, allowing an authenticated user to inject new configuration directives into the Recursor’s configuration. This issue has been assigned CVE-2017-15093.\n\nhttps://doc.powerdns.com/recursor/security-advisories/powerdns-advisory-2017-06.html\n\nCVE-2017-15094\n\nAn issue has been found in the DNSSEC parsing code of PowerDNS Recursor during a code audit by Nixu, leading to a memory leak when parsing specially crafted DNSSEC ECDSA keys. These keys are only parsed when validation is enabled by setting dnssec to a value other than off or process-no-validate (default). This issue has been assigned CVE-2017-15094.\n\nhttps://doc.powerdns.com/recursor/security-advisories/powerdns-advisory-2017-07.html"
