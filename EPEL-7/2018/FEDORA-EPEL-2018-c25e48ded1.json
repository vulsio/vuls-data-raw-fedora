This results in bird daemonizing itself. Also, when I have \"log stderr all\", I see no logs from bird after start.\n\n\nExpected results:\nThe command used should be \"/usr/sbin/bird -f\" so that bird runs in the foreground and integrates better with the systemd journal.\n\n\nAdditional info:\nI added an attachment with a patch for the unit file at /usr/lib/systemd/system/bird.service."

If you would still like\nto see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version\nof Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora\nversion prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.\n\nAlthough we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's\nlifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events.
