						"thetext": "As reported in upstream advisory:\n\n# Security adivsory for the Rust standard library - 2018-09-21 \n\nThe Rust team was recently notified of a security vulnerability affecting \nthe `str::repeat` function in the standard library. If your code does not \nuse this function, it is not affected. \n\nWe are applying for a CVE for this vulnerability, but since there is no \nembargo, we have not filed for one yet. Once a CVE is assigned, we'll make a \nsecond post to make mention of the CVE number. \n\n## Overview \n\nThis vulnerability is an instance of CWE-680: Integer Overflow to Buffer \nOverflow[1]. \n\nThe `str::repeat` function in the standard library allows repeating a \nstring a fixed number of times, returning an owned version of the final \nstring. The capacity of the final string is calculated by multiplying \nthe length of the string being repeated by the number of copies. This \ncalculation can overflow, and this case was not properly checked for. \n\nThe rest of the implementation of `str::repeat` contains unsafe code \nthat relies on a preallocated vector having the capacity calculated \nearlier. On integer overflow the capacity will be less than required, \nand which then writes outside of the allocated buffer, leading to \nbuffer overflow. \n\n## Affected Versions \n\nWhile the `str::repeat` function has been in Rust since 1.16.0, this \nvulnerability was introduced into the standard library in pull \nrequest #48657 [2]. The pull request was merged on March 6, 2018 and \nwas first part of the 1.26.0 stable released on May 10, 2018. \n\nAs such, this vulnerability affects: \n\n* Every nightly we've produced since March 6, 2018 \n* Every beta produced since March 6, 2018 \n* These specific Rust releases: \n  * 1.29.0 \n  * 1.28.0 \n  * 1.27.2 \n  * 1.27.1 \n  * 1.27.0 \n  * 1.26.2 \n  * 1.26.1 \n  * 1.26.0 \n\n## Mitigations \n\nThis bug can be mitigated manually by auditing for calls to `str::repeat` \nand testing if the resulting vector's capacity will overflow. If it does, \nthen the program should panic. \n\nFor Rust 1.29, we'll be releasing a 1.29.1 on 2018-09-25 with the fix, \nwhich consists of checking for overflow and deterministically panicking \nif it happens. Nightlies and betas produced after 2019-09-21 will also \ncontain a fix for this issue. \n\nWe will not be releasing our own fixes for previous versions of Rust. \nThe patch to fix 1.29 should roughly applicable to older versions, although \nthe implementation has seen a few refactorings since it was introduced. \nThe patch for 1.29 is included at the end of this email. If you \nneed assistance patching an older version of Rust on your own, please reach \nout to our security mailing list, secu...@rust-lang.org, and we'll be happy \nto help. \n\nThe current beta and nightly channels will be updated with a fix for this \nissue as well. \n\nReferences:\n\nhttps://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/09/21/Security-advisory-for-std.html\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rustlang-security-announcements/CmSuTm-SaU0"
