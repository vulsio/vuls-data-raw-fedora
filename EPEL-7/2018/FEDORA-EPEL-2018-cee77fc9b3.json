						"thetext": "Description of problem:\n\nI'm trying to run knot-resolver out of EPEL on CentOS 7.4.1708. Systemd opens a socket for it, but the daemon never starts, leaving these error messages in syslog:\n\n   kresd: [system] bind to '127.0.0.1@53' Permission denied\n   kresd: [system] bind to '::1@53' Permission denied\n\nWhich is weird, because the systemd unit files shipped in the package set up socket activation, which (according to the documentation at https://knot-resolver.readthedocs.io/en/stable/daemon.html#running-supervised ) should work automatically.\n\nLooking at the source code, the socket activation code is within \"#ifdef HAS_SYSTEMD\" guards. Looking at the Makefile, this #define is set if libsystemd of version 227 or above is detected. This test was added in commit 50eebc07, in august of 2016 (first released in knot-resolver-1.1.0), with the comment that the sd_listen_fds_with_names() function call requires this version. CentOS 7 has version 219:\n\n   $ rpm -qf /usr/lib64/libsystemd.so\n   systemd-devel-219-42.el7_4.4.x86_64\n\nSure enough, when I fetch the SRPM and rebuild it, the Makefile does not detect systemd:\n\n   [no] systemd (daemon)\n\nVersion-Release number of selected component (if applicable): knot-resolver-1.5.0-1.el7.x86_64\n\nHow reproducible: Always\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. yum -y install bind-utils knot-resolver-1.5.0-1.el7.x86_64\n2. systemctl start kresd.socket\n3. dig @localhost a a.root-servers.net\n\nActual results:\n\nkresd doesn't start.\n\ndig fails:\n   ;; connection timed out; no servers could be reached\n\n/var/log/messages contains:\n   kresd: [system] bind to '127.0.0.1@53' Permission denied\n   kresd: [system] bind to '::1@53' Permission denied\n   [...]\n   systemd: start request repeated too quickly for kresd.service\n   systemd: Failed to start Knot DNS Resolver daemon.\n   systemd: Unit kresd.socket entered failed state.\n   systemd: kresd.service failed.\n\n\nExpected results:\n\nkresd should start and answer the query.\n\n\nAdditional info:\n\nI assume an updated systemd isn't possible for CentOS, so can we get a unit file that starts kresd as a normal daemon instead of using socket activation?"
