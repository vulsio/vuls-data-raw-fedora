The indentation in /etc/nginx/nginx.conf looks weird, e.g. these location definitions for error pages look weirdly indented.\nP.P.S. Also the content of the error pages refers to Fedora while the package can be installed on RHEL and CentOS -- I'd suggest replace \"Fedora\" in the error page content with \"EPEL\" or something similar."

However, both mentioned builds ships vulnerable nginx versions 1.10 and 1.14 respectively. CloudForms 5.11 does not use nginx directly hence it is not vulnerable.\n\nRed Hat Quay's configuration of nginx means it's not affected by this issue. It doesn't use error_page to do a 302 redirect. It's only use of error_page uses a named location ie:\nerror_page 404 /404.html;\n   location = /40x.html {\n }\nerror_page 500 502 503 504 /50x.html;\n    location = /50x.html {\n}"
