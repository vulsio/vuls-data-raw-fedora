So, for example, Fedora 31, which is still supported, ships jbig2dec-0.16, which is potentially vulnerable to this flaw. As part of our process, we notify maintainers in community projects about the (possible) issue, but then it is up to you to choose what to do.\n\n> epel7 is based on an ancient Fedora.

Some will backport the fixes, others will update to current release, some may be able to fix it only on latest version of the project (e.g. Fedora 32) and not on all of them. Of course we can't know how each component works upstream, whether it is easy or not for you to backport the patch or fix it somehow.\n\n> Feel free to take any EPEL branches that are currently assigned to me.
