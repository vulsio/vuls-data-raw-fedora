I created those bugs to account for the fact that pip is using a vulnerable version of urllib3 (and ideally it should be fixed). I thought this might lead to some troubles, but honestly I don't know if/how this could be exploited in pip. If there's no way for an external attacker to control the HTTP method, we can surely consider closing those bugs as NOTABUG. Thanks."

This issue is already fixed upstream for all supported Python versions.\n\n`HTTPConnection` class in urllib3 inherits from the mentioned `HTTPConnection` class from the standard library which means that fixing the vulnerability only in Python itself should be enough. But, as far as I understand, the fix is implemented also in urllib3 because:\n* the library doesn't want to wait for the next Python release and\n* it still maintains support for Python 2.7 where this vulnerability won't be fixed in Python itself (upstream).\n\nPip bundles its own versions of requests and urllib3 and uses only the high level API of requests. I haven't found any possible way how a pip user migh modify the HTTP method when sending a HTTP request. And even if I would be wrong, we are going to fix this vulnerability in Python interpreters so the chain pip > requests > urllib3 > http.client will be fixed all at once.\n\nTherefore I think we can close all pip bugs as notabug."

								"thetext": "I've done an investigation of this security issue. The vulnerable method is `putrequest` from `HTTPConnection` class from `http.client` module in Python standard library. This issue is already fixed upstream for all supported Python versions.\n\n`HTTPConnection` class in urllib3 inherits from the mentioned `HTTPConnection` class from the standard library which means that fixing the vulnerability only in Python itself should be enough. But, as far as I understand, the fix is implemented also in urllib3 because:\n* the library doesn't want to wait for the next Python release and\n* it still maintains support for Python 2.7 where this vulnerability won't be fixed in Python itself (upstream).\n\nPip bundles its own versions of requests and urllib3 and uses only the high level API of requests. I haven't found any possible way how a pip user migh modify the HTTP method when sending a HTTP request. And even if I would be wrong, we are going to fix this vulnerability in Python interpreters so the chain pip > requests > urllib3 > http.client will be fixed all at once.\n\nTherefore I think we can close all pip bugs as notabug."
