						"thetext": "Description of problem:\nSlurm versions 21.08.8 and 20.11.9 are now available to address a critical security issue with Slurm's authentication handling.\n\nSchedMD customers were informed on April 20th and provided a patch on request; this process is documented in our security policy.\n\nCVE-2022-29500:\nAn architectural flaw with how credentials are handled can be exploited to allow an unprivileged user to impersonate the SlurmUser account. Access to the SlurmUser account can be used to execute arbitrary processes as root.\nThis issue impacts all Slurm releases since at least Slurm 1.0.0.\nSystems remain vulnerable until all slurmdbd, slurmctld, and slurmd processes have been restarted in the cluster.\nOnce all daemons have been upgraded sites are encouraged to add \"block_null_hash\" to CommunicationParameters. That new option provides additional protection against a potential exploit.\n\nCVE-2022-29501:\nAn issue was discovered with a network RPC handler in the slurmd daemon used for PMI2 and PMIx support. This vulnerability could allow an unprivileged user to send data to an arbitrary unix socket on the host as the root user.\n\nCVE-2022-29502:\nAn issue was found with the I/O key validation logic in the srun client command that could permit an attacker to attach to the user's terminal, and intercept process I/O. (Slurm 21.08 only.)\n\nDue to the severity of the CVE-2022-29500 issue, SchedMD has removed all prior Slurm releases from our download site.\n\nSchedMD only issues security fixes for the supported releases (currently 21.08 and 20.11). Due to the complexity of these fixes, we do not recommend attempting to backport the fixes to older releases, and strongly encourage sites to upgrade to fixed versions immediately.\n\nDownloads are available here.\nfrom https://www.schedmd.com/news.php"
