								"thetext": "It was reported [1] that certain unexpected protocol sequences cause the broker process to crash due to insufficient checking. Three distinct cases were identified as follows:\n\nThe AMQP 0-10 protocol defines a sequence set containing id ranges. The qpidd broker can be crashed by sending it a sequence-set containing an invalid range, where the start of the range is after the end. This condition causes an assertion, which causes the broker process to exit.\n\nThe AMQP 0-10 protocol defines header- and body- segments that may follow certain commands. The only command for which such segments are expected by qpidd is the message-transfer command. If another command is sent that includes header and/or body segments, this will cause a segmentation fault in the broker process, causing it then to exit.\n\nThe AMQP 0-10 protocol defines a session-gap control that can be sent on any established session. The qpidd broker does not support this control and responds with an appropriate error if requested on an established session. However, if the control is sent before the session is opened, the brokers handling causes an assertion which results in the broker process exiting.\n\nA patch is available (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/QPID-6310) that handles all these errors by sending an exception control to the remote peer and leave the broker available to all other users.\n\n[1]: http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/qpid-users/201501.mbox/%3c54B4F4AC.8030109@apache.org%3e\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the Apache Software Foundation for reporting this issue.

This may be because of CVE-2015-0223 (bug 1186308), but upstream advisory does not indicate clearly.\n\n- It identifies an additional way to trigger qpidd crash related to handling of sequence-set ranges.  That issue was assigned the CVE id CVE-2015-0224 and is tracked via bug 1186302.  Upstream commit fixing that issue is:\n\n  -> https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1654365"

Three distinct cases were identified as follows:\n\nThe AMQP 0-10 protocol defines a sequence set containing id ranges. The qpidd broker can be crashed by sending it a sequence-set containing an invalid range, where the start of the range is after the end. This condition causes an assertion, which causes the broker process to exit.\n\nThe AMQP 0-10 protocol defines header- and body- segments that may follow certain commands. The only command for which such segments are expected by qpidd is the message-transfer command. If another command is sent that includes header and/or body segments, this will cause a segmentation fault in the broker process, causing it then to exit.\n\nThe AMQP 0-10 protocol defines a session-gap control that can be sent on any established session. The qpidd broker does not support this control and responds with an appropriate error if requested on an established session. However, if the control is sent before the session is opened, the brokers handling causes an assertion which results in the broker process exiting.\n\nA patch is available (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/QPID-6310) that handles all these errors by sending an exception control to the remote peer and leave the broker available to all other users.\n\n[1]: http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/qpid-users/201501.mbox/%3c54B4F4AC.8030109@apache.org%3e\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the Apache Software Foundation for reporting this issue.

This may be because of CVE-2015-0223 (bug 1186308), but upstream advisory does not indicate clearly.\n\n- It identifies an additional way to trigger qpidd crash related to handling of sequence-set ranges.  That issue was assigned the CVE id CVE-2015-0224 and is tracked via bug 1186302.  Upstream commit fixing that issue is:\n\n  -> https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1654365"
