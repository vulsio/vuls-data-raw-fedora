It is especially important to upgrade for Redis\n                      Cluster users and for users running Redis in their laptop\n                      since a cross-scripting attack is fixed in this release.\n\nMain bugs fixes and improvements in this release:\n\n[... trimmed ...]\n\n2. As Redis 4.0 beta and the unstable branch already did (for some months at\n   this point), Redis 3.2.7 also aliases the Host: and POST commands to QUIT\n   avoiding to process the remaining pipeline if there are pending commands.\n   This is a security protection against a \"Cross Scripting\" attack, that\n   usually involves trying to feed Redis with HTTP in order to execute commands.\n   Example: a developer is running a local copy of Redis for development\n   purposes. She also runs a web browser in the same computer. The web browser\n   could send an HTTP request to http://127.0.0.1:6379 in order to access the\n   Redis instance, since a specially crafted HTTP requesta may also be partially\n   valid Redis protocol. However if POST and Host: break the connection, this\n   problem should be avoided. IMPORTANT: It is important to realize that it\n   is not impossible that another way will be found to talk with a localhost\n   Redis using a Cross Protocol attack not involving sending POST or Host: so\n   this is only a layer of protection but not a definitive fix for this class\n   of issues.\n\n3. A ziplist bug that could cause data corruption, could crash the server and\n   MAY ALSO HAVE SECURITY IMPLICATIONS was fixed. The bug looks complex to\n   exploit, but attacks always get worse, never better (cit). The bug is very\n   very hard to catch in practice, it required manual analysis of the ziplist\n   code in order to be found. However it is also possible that rarely it\n   happened in the wild. Upgrading is required if you use LINSERT and other\n   in-the-middle list manipulation commands.\n\n[... trimmed ...]\n\n================================================================================\nRedis 3.2.4     Released Mon Sep 26 08:58:21 CEST 2016\n================================================================================\n\nUpgrade urgency CRITICAL: Redis 3.2 and unstable contained a security\n                          vulnerability fixed by this release.\n\nHello Redis Wizards of the Memory Stores Empire,\n\nthis is a Redis critical release in order to fix a security issue\nwhich is documented clearly here:\n\n    https://github.com/antirez/redis/commit/6d9f8e2462fc2c426d48c941edeb78e5df7d2977\n\nThanks to Cory Duplantis of Cisco Talos for reporting the issue.\n\nIMPACT:\n\nThe gist is that using CONFIG SET calls (or by manipulating redis.conf)\nan attacker is able to compromise certain fields of the \"server\" global\nstructure, including the aof filename pointer, that could be made pointing\nto something else. In turn the AOF name is used in different contexts such\nas logging, rename(2) and open(2) syscalls, leading to potential problems.\n\nPlease note that since having access to CONFIG SET also means to be able\nto change the AOF filename (and many other things) directly, this issue\nactual real world impact is quite small, so I would not panik: if you\nhave CONFIG SET level of access, you can do more and more easily.\n\n[... trimmed ...]\n\n[1] https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antirez/redis/3.2/00-RELEASENOTES"

Terminating. because it was trying to stop a redis on 127.0.0.1 and port 0 obviously, because redis was not running on port.\n\nSo i fixed the redis-shutdown wrapper, it now uses socket, if there is one, and behaves normally when there isnt one.\n\nProposed redis-shutdown with fix is in attachment\n\nVersion-Release number of selected component (if applicable):\n3.2.8\n\nHow reproducible:\nalways\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. make redis listen on port 0\n2. start redis\n3. stop redis\n\nActual results:\nsystemd was redis.service stopping timed out\n\nExpected results:\nrestart redis service\n\nAdditional info:"
