At that time this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a\nFedora 'version' of '30'.\n\nPackage Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you\nplan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version' \nto a later Fedora version.\n\nThank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not \nable to fix it before Fedora 30 is end of life. If you would still like \nto see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version \nof Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora \nversion prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.\n\nAlthough we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's \nlifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a \nmore recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes \nbugs or makes them obsolete."

It includes the following:\n\ntime=\"<TIMESTAMP>\" level=fatal msg=\"Invalid character(s) found in prerelease \"module_f30\"\"\n\nExpected results:\n\ncri-o should start running\n\nAdditional info:\n\nThe error language is found in the semver parser (see, e.g., https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/blob/master/vendor/github.com/blang/semver/semver.go). It appears that part of the cri-o build - at least on Fedora 30 builds - is the inclusion of \"fedora_30\" as part of the version. This string is not compatible with semantic versioning and needs to be removed from consideration by the semver code. Replacing \"_\" with \"-\" might work immediately; however, it will likely cause versioning issues later on, given the semantic(!) nature of semvers. See https://semver.org/ for a complete grammar."

According to https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/blob/master/README.md it looks like these projects follow the same semantic versioning, but fedora 30 only includes modules up to the 1.14 version branch."

During the execution of the gpg binary, it is possible for the Golang garbage collector to free the referenced C structures whilst it is still required. \n\nWhen the gpg binary finishes executing, the gpgme C library is now using/referencing released memory - resulting in a use-after-free scenario."

During the execution of the gpg binary, it is possible for the Golang garbage collector to free the referenced C structures whilst it is still required. \n\nWhen the gpg binary finishes executing, the gpgme C library is now using/referencing released memory - resulting in a use-after-free scenario."
