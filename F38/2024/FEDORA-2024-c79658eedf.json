Enable DNSSEC=yes\n2. Run local unbound, configure fake local-data\n3. Set DNS=127.0.0.1\n4. resolvectl query -t example.org\nActual Results:  \n[root@rawhide ~]# resolvectl query -t a example.org\nexample.org IN A 127.0.0.1\n\n-- Information acquired via protocol DNS in 8.5ms.\n-- Data is authenticated: no; Data was acquired via local or encrypted transport: no\n-- Data from: network\n[root@rawhide ~]# resolvectl query -t aaaa example.org\nexample.org IN AAAA 2606:2800:220:1:248:1893:25c8:1946\n\n-- Information acquired via protocol DNS in 10.2ms.\n-- Data is authenticated: yes; Data was acquired via local or encrypted transport: no\n-- Data from: network\n\nExpected Results:  \nSimilar to when signature is present, -t a should be reported as invalid, only -t aaaa successful.\n\nMarking it with high severity, because it undermines purpose of whole DNSSEC presence."
