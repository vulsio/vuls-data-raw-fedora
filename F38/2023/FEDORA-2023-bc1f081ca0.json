Character set detection will no longer be included in 3.9 as a default. If this feature is needed, please use [`fallback_charset_resolver`](https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/client_advanced.html#character-set-detection).\n\n### Features\n\n- Enabled lenient response parsing for more flexible parsing in the client (this should resolve some regressions when dealing with badly formatted HTTP responses).\n\n### Bugfixes\n\n- Fixed `PermissionError` when `.netrc` is unreadable due to permissions.\n- Fixed output of parsing errors pointing to a `\\n`.\n- Fixed `GunicornWebWorker` max_requests_jitter not working.\n- Fixed sorting in `filter_cookies` to use cookie with longest path.\n- Fixed display of `BadStatusLine` messages from `llhttp`.\n\n----\n\n## llhttp 9.1.3\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Restart the parser on HTTP 100\n- Fix chunk extensions quoted-string value parsing\n- Fix lenient_flags truncated on reset\n- Fix chunk extensions’ parameters parsing when more then one name-value pair provided\n\n## llhttp 9.1.2\n\n### What's Changed\n\n- Fix HTTP 1xx handling\n\n## llhttp 9.1.1\n\n### What's Changed\n\n- feat: Expose new lenient methods\n\n## llhttp 9.1.0\n\n### What's Changed\n\n- New lenient flag to make CR completely optional\n- New lenient flag to have spaces after chunk header",
