EPEL9 has 1.46.7, which should also be affected.\n\nIn general, grpc cannot be updated in stable releases—except for patch releases, e.g. 1.48.3 to 1.48.4—without significant fallout and an exception to the Updates Policy, because it does not offer ABI or even full API stability across minor releases. For Fedora 39/Rawhide, updating to a version of grpc that is not affected by this vulnerability is desirable, but is blocked by the transition to protobuf 4 (date-based versions 22.x, 23.x, etc, vs. 3.x). A huge number of packages will be affected by the breaking changes that entails, and it is not yet clear when that update can happen or what the impact will be. To the best of my knowledge, the version of grpc in Rawhide is the last version that can be built with protobuf 3. Therefore, an immediate fix by updating grpc to the latest version is not possible in Rawhide or in stable releases.\n\nAccording to the CVE, this requires upstream pull request https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/32309—the same one that fixes bug 2214470—as well as https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/33005. I plan to investigate whether or not the changes from these PR’s can be confidently backported to 1.48.4 and/or 1.46.7."
