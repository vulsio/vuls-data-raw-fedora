So i am not sure if we\n> should enable it\n\nA couple things to keep in mind:\n\n- CFI is already default and has been used in official Chrome for Linux builds for many years now: https://www.chromium.org/developers/testing/control-flow-integrity/\n- Also according to the same link above, even though the binary will be larger, the memory impact will be a small constant: \"(read-only tables inside the binary shared between all chrome processes)\"\n- Keeping this feature disabled is a significant security degradation compared to upstream. The current settings are taking a security feature that exists and is default upstream and disabling it. This seems unjustified especially since this ask is not to add new security functionality that upstream doesn't already have.\n\nGiven the above, the memory impact should be less than expected and the security gains are significant."
