The Swift folks have been actively working towards removing Python 2 as a dependency (for example: https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/32685) but this was not done in time for Swift 5.3 as the code is frozen presumably per an internal schedule probably related to the next version of iOS, macOS, etc. \n\nThe Python 2 dependency is there because the Swift toolchain uses it for building.\n\nI do not know what version will be declared Python 2-free (next-version builds have not yet been made available per https://github.com/apple/swift/releases/) and the main branch (that the next version will be forked from) does not yet consistently build cleanly because of the number and variety of commits that is normal for a large, active project."
