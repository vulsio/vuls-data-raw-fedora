Apparantly that is wrong.\n\nI have commit rights for gs@fed but do not consider myself a maintainer, so I refrain from from version updates. But upstream has a backport for 10.01.1 so I'll check whether it's just a backport of the fix, or also of the fix to the fix ... This would be good for rawhide+f38.\n\nF37 is at gs 9.56, though. 9.55->9.56 was not exactly smooth, and bumping F37 to 10.01.1 would quite something I'm afraid."

Apparantly that is wrong.\n\nI have commit rights for gs@fed but do not consider myself a maintainer, so I refrain from from version updates. But upstream has a backport for 10.01.1 so I'll check whether it's just a backport of the fix, or also of the fix to the fix ... This would be good for rawhide+f38.\n\nF37 is at gs 9.56, though. 9.55->9.56 was not exactly smooth, and bumping F37 to 10.01.1 would quite something I'm afraid."
