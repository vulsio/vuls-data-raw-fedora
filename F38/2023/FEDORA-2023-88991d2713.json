The values `address`, `seg` and `rchassis` do not seem to be used in any dangerous way that could allow the wrongly read values to alter the execution of the program.\n\nBy looking at the code mentioned above and the commit message of the upstream patch, this is rather an out-of-bound read on the heap, which may be used to leak values from the memory of the program or, under special conditions, crash the program.\n\nThus the Impact of this flaw is set to Moderate and the CVSS is set to 7.3/CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H. In particular, Attack Vector is set to Adjacent (AV:A) as lldpd involves link layer protocols and require an attacker to be adjacent to the victim system; Confidentiality is set to High (C:H) because the values read out-of-bounds could be used to construct other packets that an attacker may read; Availability set to High (A:H) as we could not exclude the out-of-bounds read would result in a crash of lldpd when reading invalid memory."
