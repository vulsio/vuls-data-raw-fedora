These `task_ids`\nrefer to ongoing file transfers from the host to the virtual machine. An arbitrary client connected to `spice-vdagentd` via a UNIX domain socket can trigger an entry into this hash map, without the requirement that the client is associated with the currently active graphical session (function `do_agent_file_xfer_status`, specifically `vdagentd.c:1025`). There is no limit on the maximum amount of file transfers ongoing in parallel and there are no timeouts applied for a file transfer to be finished.\n\nTherefore any unprivileged local user with access to the `/run/spice-vdagentd/spice-vdagent-sock` socket path can perform a memory denial-of-service by entering a large amount of entries into this hash map. The system might enter an out of memory situation, causing a denial-of-service for spice-vdagentd or even other processes in the system."

It was reported by SUSE Security as follows:\n\nThe host application (tested with `remote-viewer` from the virt-viewer package) chooses an incrementally growing `task_id` for file exchanges\nwhich starts counting at 1. Thus the `task_id` is predictable. Since any unauthenticated local client can replace the mapping of `task_id` to client\nconnection by its own client connection, there is a possibility for an attacker to obtain parts of the transferred file data.\n\nFile data from the host system can end up in full or in parts in the client connection of an illegitimate local user in the VM system. Exploitability will be difficult if there is not a suitable side channel with information about file transfers going on. In any case active file transfers from other users can also be interrupted (DoS aspect)."

It is possible for arbitrary local users (like *nobody*) to connect to\n`spice-vdagentd` but these connections should not be able to interact with the host machine, because they don't belong to the active session.\n\nThere is a race condition between the point in time when a client performs the `connect()` call to establish a connection with `spice-vdagentd` and the time `spice-vdagentd` retrieves and checks the PID in its `agent_connect()` function. The described race condition is very hard to hit under normal circumstances, because the `agent_connect()` function in `spice-vdagentd` is very likely to run before an unrelated process gets reassigned the malicious PID in question. When combined with the file descriptor exhaustion security issue however, then this attack will become way more feasible.\n\nAn unprivileged local attacker inside a VM could use this flaw to become the \"active agent\" for `spice-vdagentd` for the graphical session of a legitimate local user. If successful then the attacker can access the host's clipboard contents or send malicious clipboard content to the host. The attacker can also retrieve file data from the host or send invalid screen resolution and display information to the host. If the victim's graphical session already runs a legitimate `spice-vdagent` then a successful attack will trigger an information leak protection logic in `vdagentd.c:874`. This has the effect of a denial-of-service, because neither the attacker nor the legitimate user will be able to use the SPICE features anymore."

An arbitrary client connected to `spice-vdagentd` via a UNIX domain socket can trigger an entry into this hash map, without the requirement that the client is associated with the currently active graphical session (function `do_agent_file_xfer_status`, specifically `vdagentd.c:1025`). There is no limit on the maximum amount of file transfers ongoing in parallel and there are no timeouts applied for a file transfer to be finished.\n\nTherefore any unprivileged local user with access to the `/run/spice-vdagentd/spice-vdagent-sock` socket path can perform a memory denial-of-service by entering a large amount of entries into this hash map. The system might enter an out of memory situation, causing a denial-of-service for spice-vdagentd or even other processes in the system."

It was reported by SUSE Security as follows:\n\nThe host application (tested with `remote-viewer` from the virt-viewer package) chooses an incrementally growing `task_id` for file exchanges\nwhich starts counting at 1. Thus the `task_id` is predictable. Since any unauthenticated local client can replace the mapping of `task_id` to client\nconnection by its own client connection, there is a possibility for an attacker to obtain parts of the transferred file data.\n\nFile data from the host system can end up in full or in parts in the client connection of an illegitimate local user in the VM system. Exploitability will be difficult if there is not a suitable side channel with information about file transfers going on. In any case active file transfers from other users can also be interrupted (DoS aspect)."

								"thetext": "The following flaw was reported by SUSE Security:\n\nOne major security property of `spice-vdagentd` is that it only allows those clients access to most of the SPICE features (like clipboard, file transfer) that are currently in an active session according to systemd. It is possible for arbitrary local users (like *nobody*) to connect to\n`spice-vdagentd` but these connections should not be able to interact with the host machine, because they don't belong to the active session.\n\nThere is a race condition between the point in time when a client performs the `connect()` call to establish a connection with `spice-vdagentd` and the time `spice-vdagentd` retrieves and checks the PID in its `agent_connect()` function. The described race condition is very hard to hit under normal circumstances, because the `agent_connect()` function in `spice-vdagentd` is very likely to run before an unrelated process gets reassigned the malicious PID in question. When combined with the file descriptor exhaustion security issue however, then this attack will become way more feasible.\n\nAn unprivileged local attacker inside a VM could use this flaw to become the \"active agent\" for `spice-vdagentd` for the graphical session of a legitimate local user. If successful then the attacker can access the host's clipboard contents or send malicious clipboard content to the host. The attacker can also retrieve file data from the host or send invalid screen resolution and display information to the host. If the victim's graphical session already runs a legitimate `spice-vdagent` then a successful attack will trigger an information leak protection logic in `vdagentd.c:874`. This has the effect of a denial-of-service, because neither the attacker nor the legitimate user will be able to use the SPICE features anymore."
