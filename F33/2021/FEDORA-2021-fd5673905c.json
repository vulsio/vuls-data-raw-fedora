The Swift folks have been actively working towards removing Python 2 as a dependency (for example: https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/32685) but this was not done in time for Swift 5.3 as the code is frozen presumably per an internal schedule probably related to the next version of iOS, macOS, etc. \n\nThe Python 2 dependency is there because the Swift toolchain uses it for building.\n\nI do not know what version will be declared Python 2-free (next-version builds have not yet been made available per https://github.com/apple/swift/releases/) and the main branch (that the next version will be forked from) does not yet consistently build cleanly because of the number and variety of commits that is normal for a large, active project."

The Swift folks have been actively working towards removing Python 2 as a dependency (for example: https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/32685) but this was not done in time for Swift 5.3 as the code is frozen presumably per an internal schedule probably related to the next version of iOS, macOS, etc. \n\nThe Python 2 dependency is there because the Swift toolchain uses it for building.\n\nI do not know what version will be declared Python 2-free (next-version builds have not yet been made available per https://github.com/apple/swift/releases/) and the main branch (that the next version will be forked from) does not yet consistently build cleanly because of the number and variety of commits that is normal for a large, active project."

Bug 1798987 (what the patch originally points to) in particular implies to me more guilt by association than an actual Wayland issue. The original reporters all mention it happens with both X11 and Wayland sessions. Forcing the GDK backend might \"fix\" it, but the issue likely lies elsewhere (probably GTK3, as noted in upstream 459[0]). I'm not saying that part of the patch shouldn't be reinstated, but I cannot reproduce the issue with 2.4.2, they even mention in 459 it may be fixed in 2.4.2[1]. If we don't reevaluate patches, they tend to get carried on forever. The rest of that patch explicitly adds some supported types (mpeg / mp3 which seem to be correctly listed now, and MIDI which does not seem to actually work for me, Audacity opens it correctly, but cannot play, possible bug?), and a fix for Fedora Studio (which no longer exists, is it somehow required by Fedora Jam?).\n\nEither way, if the GDK backend part of the patch is reinstated, an explicit requires of \"xorg-x11-server-Xwayland\" should probably be added.\n\n[0] - https://github.com/audacity/audacity/issues/459#issuecomment-649430962\n[1] - https://github.com/audacity/audacity/issues/459#issuecomment-650398472"
