The state writing side will write the blob in version x which now contains the age of the seed and the next time we read the state from the file we pick up the age from the blob."

I would probably lean towards WONTFIX here: this is not an important/critical issue and probably not worth the effort given the above comments.\n\nAs for whether or not to rebase, I don't know what implications - mostly from a functional/compatibility point of view - an upgrade to 0.8 would entail. That said, as you know, a number of potentially-security-sensitive fixes didn't get CVEs in the past (e.g., https://github.com/stefanberger/libtpms/blob/stable-0.7.0/CHANGES) and I see the risk of not backporting a security fix just because it didn't get a CVE. With this in mind IMHO rebasing should be a serious option to consider - if possible - alongside a more thorough handling of CVEs going forward (we can help with the latter part)."

In CHANGES, it is said downgrade is not possible, not upgrade. There must be a way to distinguish fixed from non-fixed version then.\n\n\n> > > sense. You need to track that 1 bit of information.

The state writing side will write the blob in version x which now contains the age of the seed and the next time we read the state from the file we pick up the age from the blob."

I would probably lean towards WONTFIX here: this is not an important/critical issue and probably not worth the effort given the above comments.\n\nAs for whether or not to rebase, I don't know what implications - mostly from a functional/compatibility point of view - an upgrade to 0.8 would entail. That said, as you know, a number of potentially-security-sensitive fixes didn't get CVEs in the past (e.g., https://github.com/stefanberger/libtpms/blob/stable-0.7.0/CHANGES) and I see the risk of not backporting a security fix just because it didn't get a CVE. With this in mind IMHO rebasing should be a serious option to consider - if possible - alongside a more thorough handling of CVEs going forward (we can help with the latter part)."
