This ties in with the minimization effort (there are many ideas, but IMO we should make it possible to have *.pyc with __pysource__/*.py, rather than the current *.py with __pycache__/*.pyc).\npyc invalidation mode should be part of that discussion, when we get time to tackle it; before that I think a patch is OK."
