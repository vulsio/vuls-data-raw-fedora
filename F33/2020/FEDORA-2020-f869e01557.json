When running under X11 mumble's Push-To-Talk button works regardless of the current keyboard focus. This is a fundamental feature of mumble since its primary use-case is to provide voice communication to people playing games (i.e. with keyboard focus applied to the game).\n\nI know this is somewhat by design for wayland. Are there any services that mumble can subscribe to allow it to monitor specific keys or shift states?\n\n\nVersion-Release number of selected component (if applicable):\nmumble-1.2.18-1.fc25 (and gnome-shell-3.22.2-2.fc25)\n\nHow reproducible:\nAlways\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Configure mumble in push-to-talk mode\n2. Choose a push-to-talk button. I am using AltGr (ISO_Level3_Shift).\n3. Connect to a mumble server\n\nActual results:\nThe lips icon turns red when my push-to-talk button is pressed if, and only if, the mumble application has keyboard focus.\n\nExpected results:\nThe lips icon should turn red when the push-to-talk button is pressed regardless of which application has keyboard focus."

If you would still like\nto see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version\nof Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora\nversion prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.\n\nAlthough we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's\nlifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events.

Calling q_SSL_shutdown() during a handshake creates an OpenSSL error that is not handled by Qt5, and closes connections, even in other QsslSockets.\n\n> Error while reading: error:140E0197:SSL routines:SSL_shutdown:shutdown while in init [20]\n\nThe patch introduces a function q_SSL_in_init() to ensure there is no active handshake and checks for any SSL errors before calling q_SSL_shutdown(). This flaw could lead to a denial of service in both the connection that called q_SSL_shutdown() and any other open connections with other clients. In order for an application to be vulnerable, it would need to utilize the SSL/TLS functionality of qt5-qtcore 5.12.2 through 5.14.2\n\nUpstream patch: https://codereview.qt-project.org/c/qt/qtbase/+/297149"
