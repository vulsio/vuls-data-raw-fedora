								"thetext": "Flaw summary:\n\nIn sftp_get_client_message() of sftpserver.c, there is code msg->complete_message = ssh_buffer_new();. There is no check for msg->complete_message being NULL and it is immediately passed into ssh_buffer_add_data() and then buffer_verify(), which will cause a NULL pointer dereference in the case where ssh_buffer_new() returned NULL. ssh_buffer_new() could return NULL if either calloc() or ssh_buffer_allocate_size() (which in some cases calls realloc()) fails an allocation in libssh-0.9.0 which is shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.\n\nThe flaw exists in libssh-0.7.1 as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Extras channel, but the code is slightly different: ssh_buffer_new() calls malloc() instead of calloc() and does not call ssh_buffer_allocate_size(), so the flaw would rely solely on malloc() failing/returning NULL in libssh-0.7.1.\n\nThis flaw could cause a crash in the sftpserver. However, because the allocations are based off of sizeof(struct ssh_buffer_struct) or a hardcoded size in malloc(), realloc() & calloc() calls, instead of externally provided input, there is no direct attacker-controlled code path to remotely trigger a NULL pointer dereference in this case."
