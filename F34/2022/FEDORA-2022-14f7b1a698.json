You are right that only owner (usually root) could change the file.  But anybody else was able to _lock_ the file using flock(1).  If the file is owned by root/root and has permission 0640, there is no problem there and the warning is not printed.\n\n> and instead log such nonsense and break or whatever just \"chmod 600>\"\n> the damend file and leave me in peace on dozens of machines\n\nThis should be harmless.  If you do not chmod the state file, the warning will be printed on the first rotation only.  The updated state file will be written with mode 0640, which prevents the warning from being printed in future runs.\n\n(In reply to Jan Zizka from comment #1)\n> This looks as CVE-2022-1348. If that is the case here are the patches, fixed in 3.20.0:\n> - https://github.com/logrotate/logrotate/commit/1f76a381e2caa0603ae3dbc51ed0f1aa0d6658b9\n> - https://github.com/logrotate/logrotate/commit/addbd293242b0b78aa54f054e6c1d249451f137d\n\nTo be clear, logrotate-3.18.1-3.fc35 has the patches applied and it is the reason why the warning is printed."
