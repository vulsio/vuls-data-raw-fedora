Please describe the problem:\nThe Qualcomm NFA765 is used on a number of 2021 AMD platforms and will be used on some 2022 platforms.\nSupport for this device has landed so I'd like to get supported added to Fedora.\n\nI've tested a build from os-build from kernel-ark and all that is needed with that is to install the firmware files to make it work. Note - I don't believe the driver support is present in the F35 branch yet, but will be there with 5.16.5 rebase.\n\nOn the FW side of things I've tested the updates here:\nhttps://github.com/kvalo/ath11k-firmware/tree/master/WCN6855/hw2.0\n\nI needed:\n - board-2.bin and regdb.bin from WCN6855/hw2.0\n - amss.bin and m3.bin from WCN6855/hw2.0/1.1/WLAN.HSP.1.1-02892.1-QCAHSPSWPL_V1_V2_SILICONZ_LITE-1 (though the 03003 version is good too)\nto be placed in /lib/firmware/ath11k/WCN6855/hw2.0\n\nUnfortunately I don't see these in the linux-firmware repository yet - but is there a way we can pull this into the Fedora release somehow please?\n\n2. What is the Version-Release number of the kernel:\n5.16\n\n3. Did it work previously in Fedora? If so, what kernel version did the issue\n   *first* appear?  Old kernels are available for download at\n   https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/packageinfo?packageID=8 :\nNo\n\n4. Can you reproduce this issue? If so, please provide the steps to reproduce\n   the issue below:\nYes - and happy to help with testing for this one.\n\n5. Does this problem occur with the latest Rawhide kernel? To install the\n   Rawhide kernel, run ``sudo dnf install fedora-repos-rawhide`` followed by\n   ``sudo dnf update --enablerepo=rawhide kernel``:\nYes\n\n6. Are you running any modules that not shipped with directly Fedora's kernel?:\nNo\n\n7. Please attach the kernel logs. You can get the complete kernel log\n   for a boot with ``journalctl --no-hostname -k > dmesg.txt``. If the\n   issue occurred on a previous boot, use the journalctl ``-b`` flag.\nI'll add these if you need them - but they're not very exciting and I'll have to go extract them from the DUT"

So one can be reasonably sure that any firmware there has been pushed there with permission from qca/ath.\n\nSo my initial thought here was that someone (e.g. me) could just take the files form there and submit them to linux-firmware, but unfortunately that repo uses a slightly different license as the linux-firmware repo, comparing:\n\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/kvalo/ath11k-firmware/master/LICENSE.qca_firmware\n\nand:\n\nhttps://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/firmware/linux-firmware.git/tree/LICENSE.QualcommAtheros_ar3k\n\nShows that the latter has the following extra section:\n\n\"Limited patent license. Qualcomm Atheros, Inc. (“Licensor”) grants you\n(“Licensee”) a limited, worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license under\nthe Patents to make, have made, use, import, offer to sell and sell the\nSoftware. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\nThe term “Patents” as used in this agreement means only those patents or patent\napplications owned solely and exclusively by Licensor as of the date of\nLicensor’s submission of the Software and any patents deriving priority (i.e.,\nhaving a first effective filing date) therefrom. The term “Software” as used in\nthis agreement means the firmware image submitted by Licensor, under the terms\nof this license, to git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/firmware/\nlinux-firmware.git.\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Licensor does not grant and\nLicensee does not receive, by virtue of this agreement or the Licensor’s\nsubmission of any Software, any license or other rights under any patent or\npatent application owned by any affiliate of Licensor or any other entity\n(other than Licensor), whether expressly, impliedly, by virtue of estoppel or\nexhaustion, or otherwise.\"\n\nWhat is esp. relevant here is the \"the firmware image submitted by Licensor\", which seems to indicate that someone from Qualcomm, or at least someone acting on behalf of Qualcomm needs to submit these.\n\nSo Mark, it seems that to get this resolved you will need to get Qualcomm to submit the necessary firmware files themselves."

I think Qualcomm should have someone actively doing this to ensure a good experience for all QCom atheros devices.\n\nFrom experience of dealing with other QCom atheros devices in the past, check the linux-firmware bugs both open and closed, their ability to \"maintain\" the firmware to a reasonable stability is doubtful to me but if Lenovo can push to get them to at least have a process and escalation contacts for them I for one would welcome that, personally until QCom actually maintain them themselves I don't thing random engineers should not be enabling the support of these devices, as it will just become a millstone around your neck."
