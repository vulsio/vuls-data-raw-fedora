PV\nguests can request two forms of mappings.  When both are in use for any\nindividual mapping, unmapping of such a mapping can be requested in two\nsteps.  The reference count for such a mapping would then mistakenly be\ndecremented twice.  Underflow of the counters gets detected, resulting\nin the triggering of a hypervisor bug check.\n\nIMPACT\n======\n\nMalicious guest kernels may be able to mount a Denial of Service (DoS)\nattack affecting the entire system.\n\nVULNERABLE SYSTEMS\n==================\n\nAll Xen versions from at least 3.2 onwards are vulnerable in principle,\nif they have the XSA-380 fixes applied.\n\nOnly x86 systems are vulnerable.  Arm systems are not vulnerable.\n\nOnly x86 PV guests with access to PCI devices can leverage the\nvulnerability.  x86 HVM and PVH guests, as well as PV guests without\naccess to PCI devices, cannot leverage the vulnerability.\n\nAdditionally from Xen 4.13 onwards x86 PV guests can leverage this\nvulnerability only when being granted access to pages owned by another\ndomain.\n\nMITIGATION\n==========\n\nNot running PV guests will avoid the vulnerability.\n\nFor Xen 4.12 and older not passing through PCI devices to PV guests will\navoid the vulnerability.\n\nFor Xen 4.13 and newer not enabling PCI device pass-through for PV\nguests will avoid the vulnerability.
