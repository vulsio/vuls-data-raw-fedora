The capability required to create new resources is only assigned to teachers/managers/admins by default, and is flagged as having a known XSS risk, meaning it is allowed to contain JavaScript content. A polyglot is not required, as standard JavaScript can be embedded within a HTML file resource directly. The reason we allow these actions by \"trusted\" users is to ensure we strike a balance between security and the ability for educators to create engaging and interactive content for their students.\""
