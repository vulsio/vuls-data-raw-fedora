In Synapse before version 1.25.0, a malicious homeserver could redirect requests to their .well-known file to a large file. This can lead to a denial of service attack where homeservers will consume significantly more resources when requesting the .well-known file of a malicious homeserver. This affects any server which accepts federation requests from untrusted servers. Issue is resolved in version 1.25.0. As a workaround the `federation_domain_whitelist` setting can be used to restrict the homeservers communicated with over federation.\n\nReference:\nhttps://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-2hwx-mjrm-v3g8\n\nUpstream patch:\nhttps://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/commit/ff5c4da1289cb5e097902b3e55b771be342c29d6"

This could cause Synapse to make requests to internal infrastructure. The type of request was not controlled by the user, although limited modification of request bodies was possible. For the most thorough protection server administrators should remove the deprecated `federation_ip_range_blacklist` from their settings after upgrading to Synapse v1.25.0 which will result in Synapse using the improved default IP address restrictions.

In Synapse before version 1.33.2 \"Push rules\" can specify conditions under which they will match, including `event_match`, which matches event content against a pattern including wildcards. Certain patterns can cause very poor performance in the matching engine, leading to a denial-of-service when processing moderate length events. The issue is patched in version 1.33.2. A potential workaround might be to prevent users from making custom push rules, by blocking such requests at a reverse-proxy.\n\nReferences:\n\nhttps://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.33.2\nhttps://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-x345-32rc-8h85\nhttps://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/commit/03318a766cac9f8b053db2214d9c332a977d226c"
