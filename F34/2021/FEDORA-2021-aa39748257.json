Good luck with finding the offending change.\n\nThe only details in this bug report are that you use TBB from a thread that calls a syscall and that triggers some signal caught by a perl process. That's terribly insufficient.\n\nWe had threads-tbb in Fedora, but we removed it because it was unreliable (read broken, bug #1099397). This one seems like you spawning a thread  using TBB from some library linked into the perl process without diverting thread-specific signals inherited from a thread that is running the perl interpreter and having registered signal handlers from perl."

So is the problem here that os-autoinst and/or tinycv should be doing some special handling of signals?"

E.g. if one thread sets a signal handler, and the other one just defaults to process termination, and the signal is delivers to the other thread, you are doomed. You must coordinate signal masks among all the threads to prevent from accidental killing. Or Linux provides a way of sending a signal to a specific thread, but that's not supported by the Perl interpreter. Also don't confuse Perl thread signals as implemented in \"threads\" Perl module and POSIX signals. Perl thread signals so not use POSIX signals at all."

TBB spawns a bunch of threads, none of which call PERL_SET_CONTEXT.  Signal handlers are registered that assume that they are running inside a perl interpreter.  When a signal arrives, the handler tries to invoke perl functionality and dies horribly because it is actually running in a perl-unaware TBB thread.\n\nWe can't (and shouldn't) make the TBB threads call PERL_SET_CONTEXT, so the only solution is to ensure that the TBB threads cannot receive the signals in question.  Upstream attempted to do that with the pull request you noted.  I will try to carve out some time to see if I can tell why that didn't work."

I was reminded of it while debugging problems with the new ppc64le worker hosts, but after looking into it more, the problems we're having there aren't to do with this crash.\n\nReproducing is a bit tricky because you need to have enough of an openQA setup deployed to run and complete a test, which isn't really trivial.

If you would still like \nto see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version \nof Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora \nversion prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.\n\nAlthough we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's \nlifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events.
