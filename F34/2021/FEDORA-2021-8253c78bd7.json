								"thetext": "Flaw summary:\n\nThe isWebPType() routine in src/webpimage.cpp is called after isCr2Type(). isCr2Type() never sets the seek back to SEEK_SET. When isWebPType() runs, it assumes that the iIo seek is at SEEK_SET and attempts to read 12 bytes of data into 3 buffers: `riff`, `data`, and `webp`. The `data` buffer is not used and thus discarded, but `riff` and `webp` are used in memcmp operations. Therefore, a crafted file could trigger this code path which can read up to 12 bytes of data past the end of iIo into the stack. We've set this to severity Low since the data is not explicitly stored and passed to other areas by this function, but it may still be reachable via some other extraneous path of exploitation and it is undefined behavior to read extraneous data.\n\nThe upstream patch uses calls to readOrThrow() instead of iIo.read() because they will catch the errors and throw Exiv2::kerCorruptedMetadata, rather than ignore them and proceed on."
