This bug was confined to the cjpeg application, whose main purpose is to demonstrate the usage of the libjpeg API library.  The library itself was not affected, and thus no other applications were affected.  Assigning a CVE to this seems like an overreaction, particularly given that the bug was a regression introduced by a new feature in a beta (non-production) release of libjpeg-turbo, and the bug was fixed two months before this Bugzilla issue was even created.  To those in the open source community, please stop abusing the term \"DoS\".  cjpeg is not, by any stretch of the imagination, a \"service\", and if it crashes rather than bowing out gracefully on a corrupt input image, that isn't a \"denial of service.\""
