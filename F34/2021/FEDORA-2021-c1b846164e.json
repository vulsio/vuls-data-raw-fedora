It's been in production working with postfix instances with -- in my use case -- no problems.\n\n~ 2 months ago, I began migrating my production OS to Fedora32.\nlacking up-to-date pkgs, and _hoping_ to no longer DIY from source, I've been running my own pkgs, built on COPR.\n\nfyi,\n https://download.copr.fedorainfracloud.org/results/pgfed/opendmarc/fedora-32-x86_64/01607172-opendmarc/opendmarc.spec\n\n( & no, it's _not_ pkg'd 'properly' for official inclusion as a F32 pkg )\n\n> I see that in [0] there is version 1.4.0-beta1, would rebase to that version be sufficient?\n\nnot IMO ...\n\n1.4.0-Beta1 was 'released' on Nov 14, 2018 -- heading for 2 years ago.  There are 11 commits since,\n\n  https://github.com/trusteddomainproject/OpenDMARC/compare/rel-opendmarc-1-4-0-Beta1...develop\n\nseveral of which are quite useful.\n\nGiven the almost complete non-responsiveness of the upstream dev @ \"Trusted Domain Project\", I don't trust the 'release' the slightest bit more than the branch tip.\n\nIME -- & backed up with comments from others -- building the latest commit has been reliable.\n\nThe *right* solution is to find & switch-to a well-maintained project; not a lot of options available afaict.  Yes, there's effort on developing OpenARC as 'next gen' solution ... but, frankly, it's from the same folks; _not_ holding my breath ...\n\nBottom line? *I* build & use the latest commit.  It works, *here*.\nI think others might be interested as well.\n\nBut, I cannot guarantee it's a 'safe bet'.  Hence, the quandary ..."
