Moreover, if the application correctly uses the array->len field to determine the size of the GBytesArray, where array is the GBytesArray returned by g_byte_array_new_take/g_bytes_unref_to_array, no other direct security problem could happen because the stored length is less than what initially was. For these reason, this flaw got a Moderate Impact."

For this reason, this flaw was rated as having a Moderate impact.\n\nAfter re-analyzing this issue, we re-evaluated this flaw as having an Important impact. This is due to the fact that the buffer allocated within GBytes could be taken through functions such as g_bytes_unref_to_data, which would report the wrong (big) size. Such data pointer and size could be used to write data into the raw buffer, wrongly assuming that `size` bytes are available in the buffer, though only a small amount of bytes have been allocated due to the integer truncation within GBytes. Such writes would be out-of-bounds and they could allow an attacker to execute code with the privileges of the application."
