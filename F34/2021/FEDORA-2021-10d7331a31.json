An out-of-bounds read was found in Exiv2 versions v0.27.3 and earlier. The out-of-bounds read is triggered when Exiv2 is used to write metadata into a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to cause a denial of service by crashing Exiv2, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. Note that this bug is only triggered when writing the metadata, which is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation than reading the metadata. For example, to trigger the bug in the Exiv2 command-line application, you need to add an extra command-line argument such as insert. The bug is fixed in version v0.27.4.\n\nReferences:\nhttps://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/security/advisories/GHSA-57jj-75fm-9rq5\nhttps://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/issues/1530\n\nUpstream patch:\nhttps://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/pull/1536"

A heap buffer overflow was found in Exiv2 versions v0.27.3 and earlier. The heap overflow is triggered when Exiv2 is used to write metadata into a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to gain code execution, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. Note that this bug is only triggered when _writing_ the metadata, which is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation than _reading_ the metadata. For example, to trigger the bug in the Exiv2 command-line application, you need to add an extra command-line argument such as `insert`. The bug is fixed in version v0.27.4.\n\nReferences:\nhttps://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/security/advisories/GHSA-v74w-h496-cgqm\nhttps://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/issues/1529\n\nUpstream patch:\nhttps://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/pull/1534"

								"thetext": "Exiv2 is a C++ library and a command-line utility to read, write, delete and modify Exif, IPTC, XMP and ICC image metadata. An out-of-bounds read was found in Exiv2 versions v0.27.3 and earlier. Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing, deleting, and modifying the metadata of image files. The out-of-bounds read is triggered when Exiv2 is used to write metadata into a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to cause a denial of service by crashing Exiv2, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. Note that this bug is only triggered when writing the metadata, which is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation than reading the metadata. For example, to trigger the bug in the Exiv2 command-line application, you need to add an extra command-line argument such as `insert`. The bug is fixed in version v0.27.4. Please see our security policy for information about Exiv2 security.\n\nReference:\nhttps://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/security/advisories/GHSA-7569-phvm-vwc2\n\nUpstream patch:\nhttps://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/pull/1587"
