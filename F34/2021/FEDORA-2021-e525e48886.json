When the attacker can separate query parameters using a semicolon (;), they can cause a difference in the interpretation of the request between the proxy (running with default configuration) and the server. This can result in malicious requests being cached as completely safe ones, as the proxy would usually not see the semicolon as a separator, and therefore would not include it in a cache key of an unkeyed parameter.\n\nReference:\nhttps://bugs.python.org/issue42967"

Especially since there are applications that use the ';' separator -- the proper fix for those would be to configure both the proxy and the app to use ';'.\nSo, here is our current plan about what to do:\n\n- Python 3.9:\n  Use the upstream behavior (split only on '&' by default, pass separator=';' to split on ';', no option to split on both).\n  This should be a 0-day update. The python39 module isn't released yet, so there's no compatiblity break.\n\n- Python 3.8: \n  - backport the `separator` argument, so users can choose to split either on '&' or on ';' eplicitly\n  - default changes to upstream (only split on '&')\n  - by setting an environment variable, you can restore the old behavior (split on both '&' or ';' by default) or choose to split on ';' by default.\n\n- Python 3.6 and 2.7:\n  - backport the `separator` argument, so users can choose to split either on '&' or on ';' eplicitly\n  - by setting an environment variable, you can choose the default separator ('&', ';', or both)\n  - if the variable is not set, the default stays as in older versions (split on both '&' and ';')\n  - if the variable is not set AND `separator` is not given AND the input includes ';', trigger a warning about the unsafe behavior. Ideally, link to a KB article in the warning.\n\nThe environment variable would be:\n  PYTHON_URLLIB_QS_SEPARATOR=unsafe\n  PYTHON_URLLIB_QS_SEPARATOR=';'\n  PYTHON_URLLIB_QS_SEPARATOR='&'"
