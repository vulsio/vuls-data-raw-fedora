Users should upgrade to the latest pip to ensure this doesn’t cause issues downloading wheels on their platform.\n* cryptography now incorporates Rust code. Users building cryptography themselves will need to have the Rust toolchain installed. Users who use an officially produced wheel will not need to make any changes. The minimum supported Rust version is 1.45.0.\n* cryptography now has PEP 484 type hints on nearly all of of its public APIs. Users can begin using them to type check their code with mypy.\n* Fixed a circular import issue.\n* Added additional debug output to assist users seeing installation errors due to outdated pip or missing rustc.\n",
