The initialization sequence is different with X11\nand this issue does not occur.\n\nI believe plasma-wayland is a great idea, and have been doing quite\na bit of testing with it, creating upstream bugs, etc.\n\nThis is the only issue I've found so far that I would consider \nseriously problematic.  The good thing is now it has been identified\nand documented.  The only problem now is getting all the upstream\ndevelopers of the upstream components on the same page.  \nWhat is your proposed mitigation if this isn't fixed?"

For instance, screen captures is a privileged operation in Wayland's security design, and  SimpleScreenRecorder doesn't support the necessary protocol. However, Wayland support was recently merged into OBS Studio so there's an alternative.\n\nScreen sharing not working in Jitsi Meet is more worrisome, because it probably affects all web-based video conferencing apps. I tried toggling chrome://flags/#enable-webrtc-pipewire-capturer, and I still cannot share the entire screen (I can share individual windows though).

Assigning this report to plasma-worspace initially is just a guess.\n\n\nHow reproducible:\nEvery time\n\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Start a Plasma Wayland session\n2. Start a terminal window\n3. ssh-add\n\nActual results:\nSsh-add can not connect to any authentication agent.  (Checking with ps, there isn't any running.)\n\n\nExpected results:\nAsking for passphrase, and adding the private keys into the agent.\n\n\nAdditional info:\nTo me this feels as a regression, but it could of course be an intentional change.  I'm also not sure if it is on Fedora level or belong upstreams.  Just let me know, and I could bring it upstreams.  If it is intentional, I believe I can figure out how to do it myself."
