At least that series is still supported.\n\nI don't know how serious this is, so if worse comes to worse and we can't update to 0.10.x in EPEL4, I'd be tempted to just WONTFIX it there.  If the code isn't similar, then perhaps this is not an issue there.  I don't know that anyone ever tested against such an old release, or it could be new code in 0.10.x."

So close how you will, but I won't be touching EL-4 for this matter.  Thanks!"

The sanitizer looks much more difficult, as the parser used for sanitation is from a completely different module, well sortof.  In 0.10.x trac makes use of HTMLParser directly from python, but in 0.11.x it makes use of HTMLParser by way of genshi, which modifies python's version of the same.  Since the vulnerability is unspecified, I don't know if it's in the content from python, or the modifications genshi has made to it.  Add to that the \"fix\" would involve starting to use genshi, which could go terribly terribly wrong.\n\nDo we have any more information about the flaw, and where it lives, and if 0.10.x and it's use of HTMLParser directly is effected?"

I'm more inclined to fix the DOS issue and leave this one alone.    \n\nOf the two, the DoS is the worst.  The sanitizing to prevent phishing would be nice, if it was realistic to put in the time and effort.  Given that, I'm ok with just fixing the DoS."
