So I need to bring up a VM and test that out, to confirm whether there WAS a problem and whether it is incidentally solved in the updates.\n\nHowever, given that this problem isn't present during initial login, and the codepath in SSSD is identical at that point, I'm inclined to believe that there's something wrong in his /etc/pam.d/system-auth file, rather than a bug in SSSD."

If SSSD encounters an LDAP server that is not secure then it should not make the system that it is running on insecure.  \n\nBeing able to unlock a computer that is running SSSD without entering a password is not a good feature and passing it off as \"not our fault\" does not make me want to use it.  We assumed that all was good with SSSD until one of the users stumbled upon the fact that he can unlock his screen without a password. \n\nFor what it's worth, pam_ldap properly asks for a password when unlocking the computer using the same LDAP server.  It'd be great is pam_sssd behaved in the same manner as pam_ldap in that a password is needed despite the configuration of the LDAP server.\n\nI will work on getting unatuthenticaed bind turned off on the Directory Servers and let you know the results.\n\nCan being prompted for a password when the LDAP server is allowing unauthenticated binds be passed on as a feature request?  I cannot imagine that I am the only person out there running my servers this way.\n\nThanks."
