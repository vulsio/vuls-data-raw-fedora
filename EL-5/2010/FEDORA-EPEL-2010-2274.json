For MITM attacker, standard CSRF attack may be even easier to mount, as it can be done by adding malicious links or javascript to any HTTP page requested by the victim.  Proper CSRF protections should block attacks via TLS MITM.  Normal CSRF attack, however, may be easier to spot by victim where client certificates are used and each certificate use must be acknowledged by user (default configuration in e.g. firefox), as prompt for certificate use will appear in unexpected moment."

						"thetext": "Answers to some frequently asked questions:\n\n\nCan renegotiation be disabled for OpenSSL / NSS?\n\nNo, current versions do not provide a way to disable renegotiations\nwithout modifications of the library, or applications using it (as was\ndone for mod_ssl).\n\n\nNew OpenSSL version 0.9.8l was released disabling all renegotiations.\nThere's no official Red Hat update providing similar fix available at\nthe moment.  Why?\n\nThere are several reasons for that:\n- Upstream fix disables all renegotiations even though it is known to\n  break valid uses where renegotiations are required (e.g. certain \n  mod_ssl setups).  That is clearly stated in the \"Workaround\" section\n  of the OpenSSL advisory:\n  \n  http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20091111.txt\n  Servers that need renegotiation to function correctly obviously cannot\n  deploy this fix without breakage.\n  \n- Upstream fix in 0.9.8l does not provide a way to re-enable\n  renegotiations without modifying application.  Post-0.9.8l versions\n  even use different way to re-enable renegotiations.\n  \n- Upstream fix introduces unexpected behavior in some cases, client\n  renegotiation request is never replied by the server instead of\n  causing the server to report handshake failure.\n  \nDue to these reasons, we do not plan to use patch included in 0.9.8l in\nthe Red Hat Security Advisories.\n\n\nDoes Red Hat plan to release NSS update that disables all renegotiations?\n\nWe're considering this.  Unlike OpenSSL, NSS has a tradition of using\nenvironment variables to control its features.  Therefore, it's \npossible to disable renegotiations by default and re-enable them only\nfor certain applications via certain environment variables. \n\n\nIs there any time line for the final fix?\n\nUnfortunately, there's no fixed time line for the final fix\nimplementing TLS renegotiation extension.  The extension is still being\ndiscussed by the IETF TLS working group and its implementations are in\nprogress."
