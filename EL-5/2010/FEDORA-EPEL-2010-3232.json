	"notes": "DRUPAL-SA-CORE-2010-002 ( http://drupal.org/node/880476 )\r\n\r\nRemember to log in to your site as the admin user before upgrading this package. After upgrading the package, browse to http://host/drupal/update.php to run the upgrade script, for each site.\r\n\r\n  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CORE-2010-002\r\n  * Project: Drupal core\r\n  * Version: 5.x, 6.x\r\n  * Date: 2010-August-11\r\n  * Security risk: Critical\r\n  * Exploitable from: Remote\r\n  * Vulnerability: Multiple vulnerabilities\r\n\r\n-------- DESCRIPTION\r\n\r\nMultiple vulnerabilities and weaknesses were discovered in Drupal.\r\n\r\nOpenID authentication bypass\r\n\r\nThe OpenID module provides users the ability to login to sites using an OpenID account. The OpenID module doesn't implement all the required verifications from the OpenID 2.0 protocol and is vulnerable to a number of attacks. Specifically:\r\n- OpenID should verify that a \"openid.response_nonce\" has not already been used for an assertion by the OpenID provider\r\n- OpenID should verify the value of openid.return_to as obtained from the OpenID provider\r\n- OpenID must verify that all fields that are required to be signed are signed\r\n\r\nThese specification violations allow malicious sites to harvest positive assertions from OpenID providers and use them on sites using the OpenID module to obtain access to preexisting accounts bound to the harvested OpenIDs. Intercepted assertions from OpenID providers can also be replayed and used to obtain access to user accounts bound to the intercepted OpenIDs. This issue affects Drupal 6.x only. A separate security announcement and release [1] is published for the contributed OpenID module for Drupal 5.x.\r\n\r\nFile download access bypass\r\n\r\nThe upload module allows users to upload files and provides access checking for file downloads. The module looks up files for download in the database and serves them for download after access checking. However, it does not account for the fact that certain database configurations will not consider case differences in file names. If a malicious user uploads a file which only differs in letter case, access will be granted for the earlier upload regardless of actual file access to that. This issue affects Drupal 5.x and 6.x.\r\n\r\nComment unpublishing bypass\r\n\r\nThe comment module allows users to leave comments on content on the site. The module supports unpublishing comments by privileged users. Users with the \"post comments without approval\" permission however could craft a URL which allows them to republish previously unpublished comments. This issue affects Drupal 5.x and 6.x.\r\n\r\nActions cross site scripting\r\n\r\nThe actions feature combined with Drupal's trigger module allows users to configure certain actions to happen when users register, content is submitted, and so on; through a web based interface. Users with \"administer actions permission\" can enter action descriptions and messages which are not properly filtered on output. Users with content and taxonomy tag submission permissions can create nodes and taxonomy terms which are not properly sanitized for inclusion in action messages and inject arbitrary HTML and script code into Drupal pages. Such a cross-site scripting attack may lead to the malicious user gaining administrative access. Wikipedia has more information about cross-site scripting [2] (XSS). This issue affects Drupal 6.x only.\r\n\r\n-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED\r\n\r\n  * Drupal 6.x before version 6.18 or 6.19.\r\n  * Drupal 5.x before version 5.23.\r\n\r\n-------- SOLUTION\r\n\r\nInstall the latest version:\r\n\r\n  * If you are running Drupal 6.x then upgrade to Drupal 6.18 [3] or Drupal 6.19 [4].\r\n  * If you are running Drupal 5.x then upgrade to Drupal 5.23 [5].\r\n\r\nDrupal 5 will no longer be maintained when Drupal 7 is released [6]. Upgrading to Drupal 6 [7] is recommended. The security team starts a new practice of releasing both a pure security update without other bugfixes and a security update combined with other bug fixes and improvements. You can choose to either only include the security update for an immediate fix (which might require less quality assurance and testing) or more fixes and improvements alongside the security fixes by choosing between Drupal 6.18 and Drupal 6.19. Read the announcement [8] for more information.\r\n\r\n-------- REPORTED BY\r\n\r\nThe OpenID authentication bypass issues were reported by Johnny Bufu [9], Christian Schmidt [10] and Heine Deelstra [11] (). The file download access bypass was reported by Dylan Tack [12] (). The comment unpublish bypass issue was reported by Heine Deelstra [13] (). The actions module cross site scripting was reported by Justin Klein Keane [14] and Heine Deelstra [15] (). (*) Member of the Drupal security team.\r\n\r\n-------- FIXED BY\r\n\r\nThe OpenID authentication issues were fixed by Christian Schmidt [16], Heine Deelstra [17] () and Damien Tournoud [18] (). The file download access bypass was fixed by Dave Reid [19] () and Neil Drumm [20] (). The comment unpublish bypass issue was fixed by Heine Deelstra [21] (). The actions module cross site scripting was fixed by Justin Klein Keane [22] and Heine Deelstra [23] ().
