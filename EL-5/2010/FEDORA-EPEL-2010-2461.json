The current initscript for spamass-milter runs the milter as account \"sa-milt\" and would have to be hacked to enable it to run as root (I will add a facility to do this, with an appropriate warning, in the next release).\n\nFurthermore, users running with SELinux enabled would have only limited exposure because the milter is confined and cannot for instance write to /tmp. It's probably limited to writing to /var/{lib,run}/spamass-milter in fact."

The current initscript for spamass-milter runs the milter as account \"sa-milt\" and would have to be hacked to enable it to run as root (I will add a facility to do this, with an appropriate warning, in the next release).\n\nFurthermore, users running with SELinux enabled would have only limited exposure because the milter is confined and cannot for instance write to /tmp. It's probably limited to writing to /var/{lib,run}/spamass-milter in fact."

	"notes": "This update includes a fix for a problem where if the milter is running using the \"-x\" option to expand aliases before passing inbound mail through SpamAssassin, a malicious client using a carefully-crafted SMTP session could execute arbitrary code on the mail server. The fix avoids the use of a shell in the alias expansion and hence there is no longer a problem with having to sanitize input from the client.\r\n\r\nThis problem has been assigned CVE-2010-1132, which is tracked upstream at https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?29136\r\n\r\nThe update also contains improved Received-header-generation for message submission and a fix for a problem where the milter would erroneously log warnings about the mail server's configuration when the first message from a non-authenticated client passed through. As part of the fix for this issue, the required milter macro configuration for the mail server has changed slightly: see the README file included in the package for details.",
