For the puppetdoc and test files the Tempfile class in ruby should be used to generate securely temporary files or maybe a temporary directory within /tmp. The class Tempfile is already used in other locations in puppet."

The same file system permissions apply to files and directories created in /tmp/ as do they anywhere else. The only difference with /tmp/ is that anyone can create files there, and anyone can list the directories content;\n\nWith umask, files created in /tmp/ would not even be group-readable or writeable:\n\n==\nEvery 1.0s: find /tmp/ -name *puppet* -exec ls -lh {} \\;                                                                                                                                                            Thu Aug 13 00:12:39 2009\n\n-rw-------. 1 root root 0 2009-08-13 00:12 ./puppet.15122.0\n==\n\nI fail to see how this is a security problem, unless the file is created with extraneous permissions before the puppet daemon creates the file itself.\n\nIf you can explain or give me some reference I'll be happy to read up ;-)"
