Perhaps it's best to just error out in this case, simply requiring a writable home directory?  That part is hard to tell for me."

This is the function that is responsible for creating the directory:\n\n\ndef intermediate_dir():\n    \"\"\" Location in temp dir for storing .cpp and .o  files during\n        builds.\n    \"\"\"\n    python_name = \"python%d%d_intermediate\" % tuple(sys.version_info[:2])\n    path = os.path.join(tempfile.gettempdir(),\"%s\" % whoami(),python_name)\n    if not os.path.exists(path):\n        os.makedirs(path, mode=0o700)\n    return path\n\n\nAs you can see, it checks if the directory already exists.\n\nCurrently I'm writing tests for this CVE. When I finish I'll attach them here so it will be pretty easy to fix this. Is this okay?"

Perhaps it's best to just error out in this case, simply requiring a writable home directory?  That part is hard to tell for me."

This is the function that is responsible for creating the directory:\n\n\ndef intermediate_dir():\n    \"\"\" Location in temp dir for storing .cpp and .o  files during\n        builds.\n    \"\"\"\n    python_name = \"python%d%d_intermediate\" % tuple(sys.version_info[:2])\n    path = os.path.join(tempfile.gettempdir(),\"%s\" % whoami(),python_name)\n    if not os.path.exists(path):\n        os.makedirs(path, mode=0o700)\n    return path\n\n\nAs you can see, it checks if the directory already exists.\n\nCurrently I'm writing tests for this CVE. When I finish I'll attach them here so it will be pretty easy to fix this. Is this okay?"
