								"thetext": "According to the upstream security report [1] the following flaw was found in OpenVPN 2.3.0 and earlier:\n\n\nOpenVPN 2.3.0 and earlier running in UDP mode are subject to chosen ciphertext injection due to a non-constant-time HMAC comparison function. Plaintext recovery may be possible using a padding oracle attack on the CBC mode cipher implementation of the crypto library, optimistically at a rate of about one character per 3 hours. PolarSSL seems vulnerable to such an attack; the vulnerability of OpenSSL has not been verified or tested.\n\nOpenVPN servers are typically configured to silently drop packets with the wrong HMAC. For this reason measuring the processing time of the packets is not trivial without a MITM position. In practice, the attack likely needs some target-specific information to be effective.\n\nThe severity of this vulnerability can be considered low. Only if OpenVPN is configured to use a null-cipher, arbitrary plain-text can be injected which can completely open up this attack vector.\n\n\nA fix has been committed to git [2]; this is corrected in OpenVPN 2.3.1 and later.\n\n[1] https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/SecurityAnnouncement-f375aa67cc\n[2] https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn/commit/11d21349a4e7e38a025849479b36ace7c2eec2ee"

It looks like in 2.3.1, existing route scripts break when they just say, e.g.:\n\n  route add -net 172.16.0.0 netmask 255.240.0.0 gw $5\n\nwith error:\n\n    /etc/openvpn/hq-routes.up tun0 1500 1545 172.16.1.2 172.16.1.1 init\n    WARNING: Failed running command (--up/--down): could not execute external program\n    Exiting due to fatal error\n\nThe workaround being to fully path 'route' as '/sbin/route'.  Fully pathing isn't a bad idea, but most of the documentation out there looks like the plain 'route' line.\n\nI looked at the openvpn changelog and don't see this being listed as purposeful, except for:\n\n      env_block(): if PATH is not set, add standard PATH setting to env\n\nbut that seems to be for win32.c, though maybe a global change made it necessary to fix on win32 and nobody noticed on unix yet."
