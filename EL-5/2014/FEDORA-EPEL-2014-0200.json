Custom or contributed modules may also provide similar lists. Under certain circumstances, unpublished content can appear on these pages and will be visible to users who should not have permission to see it.\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that it only occurs on Drupal 7 sites which upgraded from Drupal 6 or earlier.\n\n3) Security hardening (Form API - Drupal 7 - Not critical)\n\nThe form API provides a method for developers to submit forms programmatically using the function drupal_form_submit(). During programmatic form submissions, all access checks are deliberately bypassed, and any form element may be submitted regardless of the current user's access level.\nThis is normal and expected behavior for most uses of programmatic form submissions; however, there are cases where custom or contributed code may need to send data provided by the current (untrusted) user to drupal_form_submit() and therefore need to respect access control on the form.\nTo facilitate this, a new, optional $form_state['programmed_bypass_access_check'] element has been added to the Drupal 7 form API. If this is provided and set to FALSE, drupal_form_submit() will perform the normal form access checks against the current user while submitting the form, rather than bypassing them.\nThis change does not fix a security issue in Drupal core itself, but rather provides a method for custom or contributed code to fix security issues that would be difficult or impossible to fix otherwise.\n\nReferences:\nhttp://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Jan/76\n\nUpstream advisory:\nhttps://drupal.org/SA-CORE-2014-001"
