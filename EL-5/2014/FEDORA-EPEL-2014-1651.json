The problem, as I gather it, is you can have more than one user run this which is why they were using directories based on the uid.\n\nWhat would be ideal here, I think, is to have /var/run/jinja2/ created by the package and that would be the root directory (as opposed to /tmp).  Within this directory can be user-based sub-directorys (/var/run/jinja2/user or /var/run/jinga2/uid) and the code would look to a) see if it exists (if not, create with 0700 perms), and b) see if it is owned by the appropriate user (if not, complain really really loudly).\n\nThat's still not perfect, and there might still be a race condition there, but I don't think os.mkdir() will complete successfully if the named path exists as a directory or file, so should be ok).\n\nSo perhaps something like:\n\npath = '/var/run/jinja2/%s' % os.getuid()\ntry:\n    os.mkdir(path, 0700)\nexcept Exception as e:\n    raise e\n\nif os.stat(path).st_uid is not os.getuid():\n    # error and exit\n\nif oct(os.stat(path).st_mode & 0777) is not '0700':\n    # error and exit\n\nThat should work I think.\n\nThe other alternative is to again use /var/run/jinja2/ but use temp.mkstemp() to create a directory in there, but only if a config file or setting doesn't exist.  For instance, we have something like ~/.jinja2 or ~/.jinja2/config or whatever that has the setting:\n\npath = /var/run/jina2/532/tmp123456\n\nand then the module looks here first as the cache location (probably performing the same tests as above... \"is it owned by me?\" and \"is it mode 0700?\" before doing anything with it).\n\nIf such a config file/setting doesn't exist, create the file with temp.mkstemp() and write it to the config/setting for subsequent use.  If the noted file doesn't exist (or isn't usable due to failing any tests), create a new one with temp.mkstemp() and save the new path to the config file.\n\nThose seem to to be the two best options to me."

Both in terms of allowing file overwrite, and making jinja use a cache file from attacker.\n\nUpstream fix changes situation a little - attacker needs to be able to create /tmp/_jinja2-cache-$UID directory before victim, but if they succeed in doing so, they can unlink cache files created by victim at any time.\n\nThere is a separate bug for CVE-2014-0012 - bug 1052102 - albeit all the real discussion happens here."

Is that correct?\nThanks a lot!"

The problem, as I gather it, is you can have more than one user run this which is why they were using directories based on the uid.\n\nWhat would be ideal here, I think, is to have /var/run/jinja2/ created by the package and that would be the root directory (as opposed to /tmp).  Within this directory can be user-based sub-directorys (/var/run/jinja2/user or /var/run/jinga2/uid) and the code would look to a) see if it exists (if not, create with 0700 perms), and b) see if it is owned by the appropriate user (if not, complain really really loudly).\n\nThat's still not perfect, and there might still be a race condition there, but I don't think os.mkdir() will complete successfully if the named path exists as a directory or file, so should be ok).\n\nSo perhaps something like:\n\npath = '/var/run/jinja2/%s' % os.getuid()\ntry:\n    os.mkdir(path, 0700)\nexcept Exception as e:\n    raise e\n\nif os.stat(path).st_uid is not os.getuid():\n    # error and exit\n\nif oct(os.stat(path).st_mode & 0777) is not '0700':\n    # error and exit\n\nThat should work I think.\n\nThe other alternative is to again use /var/run/jinja2/ but use temp.mkstemp() to create a directory in there, but only if a config file or setting doesn't exist.  For instance, we have something like ~/.jinja2 or ~/.jinja2/config or whatever that has the setting:\n\npath = /var/run/jina2/532/tmp123456\n\nand then the module looks here first as the cache location (probably performing the same tests as above... \"is it owned by me?\" and \"is it mode 0700?\" before doing anything with it).\n\nIf such a config file/setting doesn't exist, create the file with temp.mkstemp() and write it to the config/setting for subsequent use.  If the noted file doesn't exist (or isn't usable due to failing any tests), create a new one with temp.mkstemp() and save the new path to the config file.\n\nThose seem to to be the two best options to me."

On the other hand, /var/run/jinja2/ would imply new unexpected world-writable directory for administrators to deal with.  There's a workaround to achieve better persistence by setting TMPDIR to point to a directory that isn't wiped on reboot.  I'd leave improving persistence out of scope of this security fix.

Both in terms of allowing file overwrite, and making jinja use a cache file from attacker.\n\nUpstream fix changes situation a little - attacker needs to be able to create /tmp/_jinja2-cache-$UID directory before victim, but if they succeed in doing so, they can unlink cache files created by victim at any time.\n\nThere is a separate bug for CVE-2014-0012 - bug 1052102 - albeit all the real discussion happens here."

I'm attaching a patch that should fix the security problem - it checks for both dir ownership and proper permissions.\nTomas, Vincent, can anyone of you review the patch and confirm it's ok before I commit it to RHEL and submit upstream?

Thanks!\n\n- Use os.lstat, not os.stat.  os.stat follows symlinks, so attacker can create link that points to some victim's directory with proper permission at the time of the check, and later replace with real directory, or symlink to an attacker's directory.\n\n- Consider checking if path actually is directory.\n\n(See comment 19 for the both of the above comments.)\n\n- Nitpick: use 0700 instead of 448.  448 is less obvious, are there significant benefits over 0700 to actually use it?  (I know upstream uses 448 elsewhere, so why not fix both while at it? :)\n\n- A concern with the $UID directories is that it possibly makes it somewhat easier to \"DoS\" other local user by making Jinja2 raise exception because of cache file permissions.  But the problem is not new, older Jinja2 versions could raise exception too if they found cache files they could not use."

If the path is not a directory then there are two possibilities:\n- It's owned by the user that jinja2 is running under - then Python will just fail when trying to create a file in this directory (which is actually not a directory).\n- It's owned by another user - the check for owner will rise exception before any attempt to create a cached file.\nWhat do we gain by checking that the path is directory?\n \n> - Nitpick: use 0700 instead of 448.  448 is less obvious, are there\n> significant benefits over 0700 to actually use it?

If upstream is keen on using 448, then that's what I want to do to keep consistent and to have an acceptable patch (also it's better because of the reason mentioned in comment #24 by Jakub Wilk).\n\n> - A concern with the $UID directories is that it possibly makes it somewhat\n> easier to \"DoS\" other local user by making Jinja2 raise exception because of\n> cache file permissions.

Is that correct?\nThanks a lot!"
