See [SA-CORE-2014-006](https://www.drupal.org/SA-CORE-2014-006).\r\n\r\n\r\nDrupal 7.33, 2014-11-07\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\n- Began storing the file modification time of each module and theme in the {system} database table so that contributed modules can use it to identify recently changed modules and themes (minor data structure change to the return value of system_get_info() and other related functions).\r\n- Added a \"Did you mean?\" feature to the run-tests.sh script for running automated tests from the command line, to help developers who are attempting to run a particular test class or group.\r\n- Changed the date format used in various HTTP headers output by Drupal core from RFC 1123 format to RFC 7231 format.\r\n- Added a \"block_cache_bypass_node_grants\" variable to allow sites which have node access modules enabled to use the block cache if desired (API addition).\r\n- Made image derivative generation HTTP requests return a 404 error (rather than a 500 error) when the source image does not exist.\r\n- Fixed a bug which caused user pictures to be removed from the user object after saving, and resulted in data loss if the user account was subsequently re-saved.\r\n- Fixed a bug in which field_has_data() did not return TRUE for fields that only had data in older entity revisions, leading to loss of the field's data when the field configuration was edited.\r\n- Fixed a bug which caused the Ajax progress throbber to appear misaligned in many situatons (minor styling change).\r\n- Prevented the Bartik theme from lower-casing the \"Permalink\" link on comments, for improved multilingual support (minor UI change).\r\n- Added a \"preferred_menu_links\" tag to the database query that is used by menu_link_get_preferred() to find the preferred menu link for a given path, to make it easier to alter.\r\n- Increased the maximum allowed length of block titles to 255 characters (database schema change to the {block} table).\r\n- Removed the Field module's field_modules_uninstalled() function, since it did not do anything when it was invoked.\r\n- Added a \"theme_hook_original\" variable to templates and theme functions and an optional sitewide theme debug mode, to provide contextual information in the page's HTML to theme developers. The theme debug mode is based on the one used with Twig in Drupal 8 and can be accessed by setting the \"theme_debug\" variable to TRUE (API addition).\r\n- Added an entity_view_mode_prepare() API function to allow entity-defining modules to properly invoke hook_entity_view_mode_alter(), and used it throughout Drupal core to fix bugs with the invocation of that hook (API change: https://www.drupal.org/node/2369141).\r\n- Security improvement: Made the database API's orderBy() method sanitize the sort direction (\"ASC\" or \"DESC\") for queries built with db_select(), so that calling code does not have to.\r\n- Changed the RDF module to consistently output RDF metadata for nodes and comments near where the node is rendered in the HTML (minor markup and data structure change).\r\n- Added an HTML class to RDFa metatags throughout Drupal to prevent them from accidentally affecting the site appearance (minor markup change).\r\n- Fixed a bug in the Unicode requirements check which prevented installing Drupal on PHP 5.6.\r\n- Fixed a bug which caused drupal_get_bootstrap_phase() to abort the bootstrap when called early in the page request.\r\n- Renamed the \"Search result\" view mode to \"Search result highlighting input\" to better reflect how it is used (UI change).\r\n- Improved database queries generated by EntityFieldQuery in the case where delta or language condition groups are used, to reduce the number of INNER JOINs (this is a minor data structure change affecting code which implements hook_query_alter() on these queries).\r\n- Removed special-case behavior for file uploads which allowed user #1 to bypass maximum file size and user quota limits.\r\n- Numerous small bug fixes.\r\n- Numerous API documentation improvements.\r\n- Additional automated test coverage.",
