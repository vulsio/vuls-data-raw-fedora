This is why you may often see differences between Red Hat scores and NVD or upstream scores. For instance, if there is a denial of service flaw against Apache, upstream may score it A:C (complete loss of availability) because their product is httpd. Red Hat would score this as A:P (partial loss of availability) because the underlying operating system (our product) is still available, while only one service is unavailable. Red Hat only uses A:C for flaws that would render the entire system unavailable (typically kernel flaws).\"\n\nThis is why the CVSSv2 score is A:P, and not A:C, as in the context of the operating system itself, availability is only partially affected (taking out the Zarafa server does not take out the entire system).\n\nFrom Zarafa's point of view, however, if they were to use CVSSv2 to rate this, they would likely use A:C.\n\nI hope that explains it clearly enough."

And not at all related to CVE-2014-0037 right?\n\nYes, this is the second issue. This issue is similar - maybe you can simply\nhave a look to the patch of this one and that one of CVE-2014-0037: This one \nrefers to a NULL pointer of the password, the CVE-2014-0037 refers to a NULL \npointer of the username. Obviously the exploitation is quite similar, too.\n\nYou still can exploit this issue even when CVE-2014-0037 is fixed (and also\nthe other way round). The two issues are related that way that they are both\nin the same source code functions and both related to authentication data.\nDo these information help you? If you say that these should be treated like\none issue, let's do it...I'm not an expert here. I am also sorry that I did\nnot figure out this issue already months ago (but upstream did neither).\n\n> Upstream is still unaware of this one?\n\nI noticed upstream yesterday evening via e-mail about the issue including the\npatch and also the fact that Fedora is shipping the patch already - see:\nhttp://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/zarafa.git/tree/zarafa-7.1.8-nullptr.patch\nUnfortunately there was no reply by upstream so far. Shall I send a reminder\nhaving the RHSRT on Cc?\n\nDoes it make sense to keep this one embargoed (as the patch is public)? I\nmarked this only as such because the referenced CVE-2014-0037 was embargoed\nat the time of opening this one. If you manage to exploit CVE-2014-0037 it\nis more than trivial to exploit this issue, too."
