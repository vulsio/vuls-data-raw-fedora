The Heartbleed related patches add blacklist logic (client-side) to ignore nodes with keys that may have been compromised. There are 9 keys in this blacklist.

Tor doesn't really provide an ABI which is consumed by other projects throughout the distro so I wouldn't worry too much about breaking ABI. \n\n>  2) Remain at 0.2.3.25 but use the backported patches\n\nThere's really no way to viably do this. 0.2.3.x was released almost two years ago at this point so there'd be a number of patches which would need backport. Seems like a lot of work for no gain over the first option.\n\n>  3) Do nothing and wait for 0.2.3.26 release\n\nIs there actually going to be a 0.2.3.26 release?\n\n> \n> I'm tempted to update to 0.2.4.22 on all branches.
