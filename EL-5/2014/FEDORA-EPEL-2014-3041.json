The primary developer is still responsive to issues and has shown interest in reviewing patches in the past so I am still in favour of discussing this issue in the upstream mailing list rather than just patch something in Fedora. This is especially the case here since it is a security sensitive software.\n\nAlso since you seem interested enough to write a patch, you might consider being a co-maintainer of this package in Fedora. \n\nhttp://fedoraproject.org/wiki/PackageMaintainers/Join\n\nDrop me a mail if you need further details.\n\n--- Additional comment from Derek Martin on 2009-02-18 09:31:42 EST ---\n\nHi Rahul...  Mainly these days I concern myself with security-related issues.  I'm not really working on rssh, and I'm not really accepting patches except for non-trivial security holes.  For mainly that reason, but also because I think it was irresponsible for the rsync maintainers to overload an option which was intended to allow execution of arbitrary programs to also send protocol information, I won't be adding any patches related to supporting rsync 3.  That said, I do see the value in doing so, so if you feel it is appropriate by all means add the patch.\n\n--- Additional comment from Rahul Sundaram on 2009-02-18 14:54:18 EST ---\n\nThanks for the feedback. Appreciate it. Can you quick look at the patch and confirm it is ok? I will be willing to add it as a downstream patch then.\n\n--- Additional comment from Lyonel Vincent on 2009-02-18 16:09:48 EST ---\n\nHi Rahul,\n\nMaybe we can just use the same patch as Debian; it looks more generic (and probably more tested)...\n\nhttp://patch-tracking.debian.net/patch/series/view/rssh/2.3.2-8/rsync-protocol\n\n--- Additional comment from Rahul Sundaram on 2009-02-18 16:21:10 EST ---\n\nYeah, rssh was primarily imported for OLPC and I think, they wanted the patch too. I will be offline till Monday but I will try to coordinate and get this done asap.Thanks.\n\n--- Additional comment from Derek Martin on 2009-02-19 20:27:32 EST ---\n\n(In reply to comment #7)\n> Thanks for the feedback. Appreciate it. Can you quick look at the patch and\n> confirm it is ok? I will be willing to add it as a downstream patch then.\n\nTo be honest, I really don't want to. :)  That's the main reason I've all but abandoned the project...  It's not dead exactly, but I'm only interested in fixing serious security issues.  Aside from that, I really don't want to spend any time on this thing.  I'd be rather happy if someone who cared would take over maintenance of it, in fact, so people will stop bothering me about it... ;-)  \n\nWhile I may have exaggerated the grossness of the rsync maintainers' decision to overload command-line options in my last response, I do think it's gross, tainting an otherwise excellent peice of software.  And I think people's time would be more appropriately (though likely more futilely) spent convincing them to fix their backward-compaitibility problem a different way that's less gross.  It's worth pointing out that rssh is not the only program that rejects command lines that contain unapproved strings in an effort to enforce security (sudo, ssh, other restricted shells, and other programs have features that do this too).  In sending protocol information with -e (both harmless and now necessary),  overloading an option whose original purpose was to allow arbitrary execution of programs (neithre harmless nor necessary), they've exercised poor judgment and made things more difficult for sysadmins who have a need to try to secure the use of their tool.\n\n--- Additional comment from Rahul Sundaram on 2009-03-30 06:05:48 EDT ---\n\nI think, I will not add this patch for now. If OLPC wants it, I will reconsider picking up the patch from Debian later. Thanks for all your input.\n\n--- Additional comment from Rahul Sundaram on 2012-02-06 17:24:14 EST ---\n\n\nDaniel Drake just mailed me that he needs this for OLPC and it is important for them.   I still would very much prefer if rssh upstream accepted it but that doesn't seem like it is happening but atleast in this case Debian seems to have been carrying this patch for a long time already and it is known to be functional. I am reopening for now.  Daniel,  do close this as fixed when you have applied the patch.   Please follow https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging/Guidelines#All_patches_should_have_an_upstream_bug_link_or_comment and add a comment indicating the origin of the patch, link to comment #10 as well.

This additional patch is required, as rsync 3.x overloads -e command line argument - when --server option is also specified, -e is used to pass protocol version and additional flags.  Additional info on the rsync 3.x support can be found in the following bugs:\n\nhttps://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=485946\nhttp://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=471803\n\nThis patch has never been accepted upstream, hence upstream versions of rssh (up to the current 2.3.3) were not affected by this problem.  rssh packages in EPEL-5 also do not include this patch yet (bug 878113) and are not affected."
