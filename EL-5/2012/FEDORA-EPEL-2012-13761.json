Actually ... there seems to be  php53-5.3.3-13.el5_8 now in RHEL-5. I have to figure out what's the status and availability of it (taking over bug 855156)."

Being that EPEL5 has another 5 years or so in it, probably staying with WP 3.1.x for the length of it is going to be tricky.  I assume from the below that keeping the 'wordpress' package on this branch is for the purposes of maintaining compatibility with the default php package, but since we have 5.3 shipping as well, does it now make sense to also ship a wordpress53 package in EPEL5 and track their releases, at least until such a point as Wordpress requires a PHP > 5.3? (seems like that would be a while, perhaps 5 years).\n\nI can package up 3.4.1 for EL5 and post the SPEC patches for the above (minimal) if somebody tells me it's an acceptable approach for EPEL5.\n\n\n+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #720429 +++\n\nDescription of problem:\nhttps://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.2\n PHP 5.2.4 or greater (old requirement - since WordPress 2.5 was PHP 4.3 or greater) \n\nVersion-Release number of selected component (if applicable):\nwordpress-3.2\n\n--- Additional comment from mcepl@redhat.com on 2012-04-23 07:51:12 EDT ---\n\nWordpress will stay on 3.1 line in EPEL-5."
