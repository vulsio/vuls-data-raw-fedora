You are effectively saying that, because it's difficult, we won't do it.  Maybe the impact is low enough that it won't matter if we don't fix it, but we need to look into it.  At a quick glance, there are a few important packages that link to libarchive: PackageKit, kdeutils, gvfs-archive, and anaconda (the last probably isn't very significant in this context).\n\nIf none of these packages use the vulnerable functionality, then I have no problem with closing this (once it is corrected in Fedora).  If they do, however, then we will need to come up with our own fix and backport what is applicable to close the hole."

You are effectively saying that, because it's difficult, we won't do it.  Maybe the impact is low enough that it won't matter if we don't fix it, but we need to look into it.  At a quick glance, there are a few important packages that link to libarchive: PackageKit, kdeutils, gvfs-archive, and anaconda (the last probably isn't very significant in this context).\n\nIf none of these packages use the vulnerable functionality, then I have no problem with closing this (once it is corrected in Fedora).  If they do, however, then we will need to come up with our own fix and backport what is applicable to close the hole."
