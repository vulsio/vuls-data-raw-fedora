						"thetext": "This bug relates to inefficient processing of some ANSI escape sequences by the Mosh terminal emulator.\n\nAn application or mosh-server can send a large value as the \"repeat count\" of an ANSI escape sequence, causing the mosh-server or mosh-client to spend a lot of CPU time interpreting a short ANSI escape sequence.\n\nBecause these applications are already trusted, this is not a security vulnerability per se. For example, the application is also able to shut off the user's keyboard with an ANSI escape sequence -- also not a security vulnerability. Because ANSI escape sequences can do arbitrary things to the user's terminal, programs that allow untrusted user-to-user communication (including write(1), wall(1), and e-mail and newsgroup readers) need to filter these out.\n\nMosh 1.2.1 will contain code to avoid spending all this CPU time by ignoring nonsensical repeat counts. But in general, any terminal emulator must trust the application, since the application decides what should be on the screen. If it wants to fill the screen with garbage or send a lot of beeps or turn off the user's keyboard, most terminal emulators will do what the applicaiton asks. These are matters of discretion and are not security vulnerabilities. (Similarly, the mosh-client must trust the mosh-server to decide what is on the screen and whether to accept user input.)\n\nWe have suggested this text as the issue description:\n\n===\nMosh versions 1.2 and earlier allow an application to cause the mosh-server to consume large amounts of CPU time with a short ANSI escape sequence. In addition, a malicious mosh-server can cause the mosh-client to consume large amounts of CPU time with a short ANSI escape sequence. This arises because there was no limit on the value of the \"repeat\" parameter in some ANSI escape sequences, so even large and nonsensical values would be interpreted by Mosh's terminal emulator.\n===\n\nThis gets away from the suggestion that the problem relates to \"improper parsing\" or the \"count of parameters\" (it's about wanting a limit on the _value_ of parameters so the terminal emulator doesn't do huge amounts of work to execute a very short sequence), or to data coming from \"a remote attacker.\"\n\nThank you,\nKeith Winstein\nMosh project"
