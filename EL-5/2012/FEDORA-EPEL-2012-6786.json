Berrange <berrange@redhat.com>\nDate:   Mon May 28 15:04:31 2012 +0100\n\n    Add some missing hook functions\n    \n    A core use case of the hook scripts is to be able to do things\n    to a guest's network configuration. It is possible to hook into\n    the 'start' operation for a QEMU guest which runs just before\n    the guest is started. The TAP devices will exist at this point,\n    but the QEMU process will not. It can be desirable to have a\n    'started' hook too, which runs once QEMU has started.\n    \n    If libvirtd is restarted it will re-populate firewall rules,\n    but there is no QEMU hook to trigger for existing domains.\n    This is solved with a 'reconnect' hook.\n    \n    Finally, if attaching to an external QEMU process there needs\n    to be an 'attach' hook script.\n    \n    This all also applies to the LXC driver\n    \n    * docs/hooks.html.in: Document new operations\n    * src/util/hooks.c, src/util/hooks.c: Add 'started', 'reconnect'\n      and 'attach' operations for QEMU. Add 'prepare', 'started',\n      'release' and 'reconnect' operations for LXC\n    * src/lxc/lxc_driver.c: Add hooks for 'prepare', 'started',\n      'release' and 'reconnect' operations\n    * src/qemu/qemu_process.c: Add hooks for 'started', 'reconnect'\n      and 'reconnect' operations"

After updating, the munin-check script shows the following errors in permissions:\n\n# /var/lib/munin/plugin-state : Wrong owner (munin != nobody)\n# /var/lib/munin/plugin-state : Wrong permissions (755 != 775)\n\nThe reason this came up and the reason I even know about the munin-check script is because CentOS 6 fresh munin installs were not reporting the statistics that they should have been. The primary one that I noticed was Disk I/O. Running \"munin-check -f\" solves this issue, but I'm not sure if this is a bug in the munin-check script or with the munin install itself.\n\n\nVersion-Release number of selected component (if applicable):\n0:1.4.7-5.el6\n\nHow reproducible:\nFresh install of munin on CentOS 6.2, or an update to the most current version. Then running \"munin-check\".\n\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.Install munin, make sure that it can start up correctly and the apache page is available. This may not be entirely necessary, but it did help me identify which items were reporting and which were not.\n2. Run \"munin-check\"\n3.\n  \nActual results:\n# /var/lib/munin/plugin-state : Wrong owner (munin != nobody)\n# /var/lib/munin/plugin-state : Wrong permissions (755 != 775)\n\nExpected results:\nExpected the output to be the same as it is after \"munin-check -f\" which fixes the permissions.\n\n\nAdditional info:"
