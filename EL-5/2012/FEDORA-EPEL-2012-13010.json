Second mistake is that \"dbcheck -B\" is absolutely\nnot supported in such an old version of Bacula. I tried to backport that,\nbut it seems that it is not that trivial because the changed code also has\na dependency on other Bacula code parts that have been rewritten in parts.\n\nWhy the heck did you not proper test this before breaking things that way\nand even incompatible?
