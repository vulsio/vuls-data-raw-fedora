						"thetext": "The following appear to be minor issues, not leading to crashes or worse (at most information disclosure due to limited buffer over-reading).\n\n__pmGetPDU should enforce minimum PDU lengths, based on a table of per-type minimum values.  This way, individual length checks won't have to be added to decoding functions for constant-size PDUs (such as __pmDecodeLogStatus, __pmDecodeTextReq, __pmDecodeError).\n\n__pmDecodeTextReq should initialize *ident in all cases.\n\n__pmEncodeResult seems to produce vlen fields for non-PM_VAL_INSITU values which are too large in some cases.  Truncating strings at the first NUL byte during decoding appears to hide this.  This is visible with proc.psinfo.cmd, for instance."

So that went out with 3.6.5, but spread across the many individual patches for each PDU type.\n\nFor the second issue, related to *ident not being initialized, that is fixed by the patch coming shortly.  Its minor though, can't see anything exposed there, will go into pcp-3.6.6.\n\nI'll have to look a bit deeper into the result encoding issue and report back later."

						"thetext": "OK, I understand the third case now.  The encode function is a bit misleading - it contains code that is marked #ifdef PCP_DEBUG, that initialises the parts of the buffer which I think Florian is calling out here.  It turns out that in all builds of PCP, this \"debug\" macro is always set.  So these parts of the passed out buffer are in fact initialised (with \"~\" character) after all, always.\n\nI believe the patch I posted earlier is all we will need for this issue now, and I concur fully with Florian's assessment of these ones being minor issues that are not critical to push immediately.  The patch I posted earlier will go with the pcp-3.6.6 release, which will likely happen with the next two weeks."

This would give me additional confidence before doing the next\nPCP release.\n\nAlternatively, I could do a release later this and push into Fedora for\nfurther testing if thats easier?  (I'd prefer the former if possible, so\nI don't have to do additional fixup releases later).\n\nRPMs can be generated from the git tree using the \"./Makepkgs\" script if\nthat helps at all.\n\nFWIW, the particular problem listed earlier in this bug with RHEL5 sar\ndata was resolved by this commit:\n\ncommit 11f0e2a371fb05940209b36423bb4731e2f9ea82\nAuthor: Nathan Scott <nathans@redhat.com>\nDate:   Sat Sep 22 21:51:08 2012 +1000\n\n    Fix another problem in sar2pcp handling of ancient sar archives\n    \n    Really old versions of sysstat used commas in place of decimal\n    points in the XML floating point numbers.  This causes failure\n    whenever perl attempts to convert that string to a float.  So,\n    we need to fix up the number (give it a decimal point instead\n    of a comma) before doing any arithmetic or attempting to store\n    the number.\n    \n    This is the cause (if you should ever observe it) of this type\n    of perl warning/failure message:  (e.g.)\n      'Argument \"\\x{31}\\x{2c}...\" isn't numeric in addition (+)'\n    \n    Red Hat Bugzilla: 859117\n\n\nThere are a number of other fixes in there too, however, so its worth\ngetting the complete set (via git clone/pull) before testing anything.\n\ncheers."

It differs to using the higher level tools like\npmval in that it doesn't do interpolation or rate-conversion on any\ncounter metrics, etc.  It's a handy way to see the original logging\nfrequency too (pmval will do 1sec reporting, or -t <interval>, which\nis independent to the native logged frequency.\n\nBut thats not directly relevent to this issue, just for reference. :)\n\nThanks for testing it out!\n\ncheers."
