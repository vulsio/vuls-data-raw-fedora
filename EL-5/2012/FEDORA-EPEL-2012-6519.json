First, on systems that do have mktemp, I think it should never fall back to using unsafe temp file.  If mktemp can't make safe temp file, the script is even less likely to be able to do it.  As for the unsafe code path, you can still race against the check (create /tmp/mtx.$$ after test, but before the script writes to it), or overwrite device files with no race (think of mtx.$$ being symlink to e.g. /dev/sda).\n\n> I believe that writing in /tmp/mtxloaded is not the same issue, because this\n> file is deleted before (maybe this is the second possible way how to fix this).\n\nIt's different in a way that an attacker needs to race against the script and create malicious symlink between rm and re-creation of the file.  The way the file is created is still unsafe, and the race should not be all that hard to win."

First, on systems that do have mktemp, I think it should never fall back to using unsafe temp file.  If mktemp can't make safe temp file, the script is even less likely to be able to do it.  As for the unsafe code path, you can still race against the check (create /tmp/mtx.$$ after test, but before the script writes to it), or overwrite device files with no race (think of mtx.$$ being symlink to e.g. /dev/sda).\n\n> I believe that writing in /tmp/mtxloaded is not the same issue, because this\n> file is deleted before (maybe this is the second possible way how to fix this).\n\nIt's different in a way that an attacker needs to race against the script and create malicious symlink between rm and re-creation of the file.  The way the file is created is still unsafe, and the race should not be all that hard to win."
