Reporters were able to find colliding strings efficiently using meet in the middle attack.\n\nAs various web application frameworks for Python automatically pre-fill certain dictionaries with data from the HTTP request (such as GET or POST parameters) for Python web application, a remote attacker could use this flaw to make Python interpreter use excessive amount of CPU time by sending a POST request with large amount of parameters which hash to the same value.\n\nThis problem is similar to the issue that was previously reported for and fixed in e.g. perl:\n  http://www.cs.rice.edu/~scrosby/hash/CrosbyWallach_UsenixSec2003.pdf"

This seems to work for all of python's test suite, and very quickly detects and complains about hostile input.  It's rather experimental though, and the ratio/scale-factor is a number I chose arbitrarily, and I haven't gone through the math or gathered real numbers on real code.  There are a few issues that would need fixing (see Antoine Pitrou's comments on it).\n\nHowever, there's an argument that any approach that can lead to dict (or set) raising an exception is flawed: see http://bugs.python.org/issue13703#msg151796  It strikes me that this \"protection\" may allow yet another new class of attack, it which the attacker slowly poisons inputs, so that when a dict is constructed at some later point, an exception is raised you weren't expecting.  If the protection wasn't there you'd get the extreme slowdown, rather an exception.  But: my patch is too good :)  it's too efficient at detecting when it's under attack: the exception is raised too quickly, and so arguably we've made the job easier for the attacker.  But maybe I'm overthinking this?  Perhaps I just need to tune things?\n\n(D) http://bugs.python.org/issue13703#msg151847\nin which I backported haypo's hash randomization patch from the main branch to the 2.7 branch.  This patch disables the hash randomization by default, and only does it for string-like types, not numeric types (for reasons noted in that comment).  When enabled with \"PYTHONHASHRANDOMIZATION=1 python\", this patch successfully blocks the reproducer.  (there's also another hash randomization patch beyond haypo's, which does a few things a little differently; see python issue 13704).\n\nNote that hash randomization is known to break Django's test suite, which is why I'm wary about enabling it by default."

It detects when a given dict is under attack, and transitions just that dict to use randomized hashes.\n\nIt preserves ABI - however, in order to do this, the randomization only happens for str/unicode/bytes keys.  I believe this is a reasonable compromise, given the various attack scenarios on a web server (e.g. it should cover HTTP headers, POST fields, JSON, XML-RPC).\n\nIt will probably need performance tuning and extensive testing."

This causes no issues for most use cases, but may cause problems where updated Python standard library is used with not updated Python executable.  Such problem was reported for Python virtualenv use cases, see:\n\nhttp://bugs.python.org/issue14444#msg158172\n\nThe above link also provides instructions on how to fix the problem.  These instructions are also available on the virtualenv project news page:\n\nhttp://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/news.html\n\n  Warning: Python bugfix releases 2.6.8, 2.7.3, 3.1.5 and 3.2.3 include a\n  change that will cause “import random” to fail with “cannot import name\n  urandom” on any virtualenv created on a Unix host with an earlier release\n  of Python 2.6/2.7/3.1/3.2, if the underlying system Python is upgraded.\n  This is due to the fact that a virtualenv uses the system Python’s standard\n  library but contains its own copy of the Python interpreter, so an upgrade\n  to the system Python results in a mismatch between the version of the Python\n  interpreter and the version of the standard library. It can be fixed by\n  removing $ENV/bin/python and re-running virtualenv on the same target\n  directory with the upgraded Python."
