The default upload size is 30\nMB (via /etc/httpd/conf.d/zarafa-webaccess.conf / zarafa-webapp.conf).\n\nI do not know if $tmpname is predictable (for race conditions) but likely\nnot. The 2nd parameter is only a prefix according to the PHP documentation\nof tempnam().\n\nFrom my point of view the file \"senddocument.php\" is neither referenced nor\nused anywhere in the code and could be simply removed.\n\nUpstream has been notified and I am awaiting their response.

The PDF you refer to\nis from the management of upstream - and is also the best reply I received\nregarding this issue.\n\n> Should we align the distros notification with the release schedule of 7.1.12\n> and 7.2.0?\n\nI'm unfortunately not aware of any planned release date of 7.1.12 or 7.2.0;\nI guess you are looking for a CRD (Coordinated Release Date).\n\nRumours for 7.2.0 are from Q3/2014 to Q1/2015 [1], but 7.1.12 is overdue\naccording to their Jira roadmap [2] (as of writing it shows 2014-09-02).\nNormally there is a beta/preview about 14+ days available before a final\nrelease [3]. Doing the math based on previous releases (one .z release per\ntwo months) shows a slight delay due to the lack of a beta/preview, too.\n\n> Will it cause you grief with them if the issue is made public before they\n> fix it?\n\nGood question, I have no idea.\n\n\n[1] http://doc.zarafa.com/trunk/Support_Lifecycle_Policy/en-US/html/_major_release_cycle.html\n[2] https://jira.zarafa.com/browse/ZCP/?selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:roadmap-panel\n[3] https://download.zarafa.com/community/beta/7.1/"
