OpenSSL includes a certificate management tool and shared\nlibraries which provide various cryptographic algorithms and protocols.\n\n\nThis package is intended only for EPEL 5 to provide some kind of forward\ncompatibility for specific applications. RHEL 5 is only shipping the very\nold openssl-0.9.8e-34.el5_11. So this is openssl-1.0.1e-30.el6.8 from RHEL\n6 modified to be installable along with the regular package. The package\nitself was as less modified as possible to make the differences hopefully\neasily reviewable."

Reviewers should use sha256sum for this task as it is used by the sources file once imported into git. If no upstream URL can be specified for this package, please see the Source URL Guidelines for how to deal with this.\n\nConsistent with 'When Upstream uses Prohibited Code'\n\n+  The package MUST successfully compile and build into binary rpms on at least one primary architecture. \nNA If the package does not successfully compile, build or work on an architecture, then those architectures should be listed in the spec in ExcludeArch. NA Each architecture listed in ExcludeArch MUST have a bug filed in bugzilla, describing the reason that the package does not compile/build/work on that architecture. The bug number MUST be placed in a comment, next to the corresponding ExcludeArch line. \n+ All build dependencies must be listed in BuildRequires, except for any that are listed in the exceptions section of the Packaging Guidelines ; inclusion of those as BuildRequires is optional. Apply common sense.\n+ The spec file MUST handle locales properly. This is done by using the %find_lang macro. Using %{_datadir}/locale/* is strictly forbidden.\n+ Every binary RPM package (or subpackage) which stores shared library files (not just symlinks) in any of the dynamic linker's default paths, must call ldconfig in %post and %postun. \n+ Packages must NOT bundle copies of system libraries.\n+ If the package is designed to be relocatable, the packager must state this fact in the request for review, along with the rationalization for relocation of that specific package. Without this, use of Prefix: /usr is considered a blocker. \n\nDoes not claim to be relocatable\nDoes hardcode /usr in: --with-krb5-dir=/usr\n\n+ A package must own all directories that it creates. If it does not create a directory that it uses, then it should require a package which does create that directory. \n\nDirectories are owned by openssl which is Required: by this package  \n\n+ A Fedora package must not list a file more than once in the spec file's %files listings. (Notable exception: license texts in specific situations)\n? Permissions on files must be set properly. Executables should be set with executable permissions, for example. \n\nQuestion outstanding from rpmlint output\n\n+  Each package must consistently use macros. \n+  The package must contain code, or permissible content. \n+  Large documentation files must go in a -doc subpackage. (The definition of large is left up to the packager's best judgement, but is not restricted to size. Large can refer to either size or quantity). \n+  If a package includes something as %doc, it must not affect the runtime of the application. To summarize: If it is in %doc, the program must run properly if it is not present. \n+  Static libraries must be in a -static package. \n+  Development files must be in a -devel package. \n+  In the vast majority of cases, devel packages must require the base package using a fully versioned dependency: Requires: %{name}%{?_isa} = %{version}-%{release} \n+  Packages must NOT contain any .la libtool archives, these must be removed in the spec if they are built.\nNA Packages containing GUI applications must include a %{name}.desktop file, and that file must be properly installed with desktop-file-install in the %install section. If you feel that your packaged GUI application does not need a .desktop file, you must put a comment in the spec file with your explanation. \n+ Packages must not own files or directories already owned by other packages. The rule of thumb here is that the first package to be installed should own the files or directories that other packages may rely upon. This means, for example, that no package in Fedora should ever share ownership with any of the files or directories owned by the filesystem or man package. If you feel that you have a good reason to own a file or directory that another package owns, then please present that at package review time. \n+ All filenames in rpm packages must be valid UTF-8. \n\n\nSHOULD\nNA If the source package does not include license text(s) as a separate file from upstream, the packager SHOULD query upstream to include it. \nNA The description and summary sections in the package spec file should contain translations for supported Non-English languages, if available. \n+ The reviewer should test that the package builds in mock. \n+ The package should compile and build into binary rpms on all supported architectures. \n? The reviewer should test that the package functions as described. A package should not segfault instead of running, for example.\n\nI do not have a centos5 box to test on\n\n+ If scriptlets are used, those scriptlets must be sane. This is vague, and left up to the reviewers judgement to determine sanity. \n+ Usually, subpackages other than devel should require the base package using a fully versioned dependency. \n+ The placement of pkgconfig(.pc) files depends on their usecase, and this is usually for development purposes, so should be placed in a -devel pkg. A reasonable exception is that the main pkg itself is a devel tool not installed in a user runtime, e.g. gcc or gdb. \nNA If the package has file dependencies outside of /etc, /bin, /sbin, /usr/bin, or /usr/sbin consider requiring the package which provides the file instead of the file itself. \n- your package should contain man pages for binaries/scripts. If it doesn't, work with upstream to add them where they make sense.\n\nThere is one missing as per rpmlint"

But\nI don't know (and don't see) why there are treated as 'strange-permission'.\n\n(In reply to Andrew Beekhof from comment #6)\n> wrt. man pages, does the new one differ much from the existing one?

Given the old man pages will be anyway always there, I am not sure if it\nmakes sense to supply the \"new\" ones being not really a benefit but having\nstrange names (because otherwise they would conflict with the main openssl\npackages). The online documentation of OpenSSL is more up-to-date through. I\nthink (if at all) it only makes sense for \"man openssl101e\" given that is the\nonly binary being named different where one could expect another man page.\n\nSomething else left?"
