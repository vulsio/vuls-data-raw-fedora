Directly in the sense, the proposed upstream patch\nfrom above comment would not be easily applicable.\n\nBut if I got the openslp v1.2.1 vs v2.0.beta1 right:\n1), in v2.0.beta1 slp_v1message.c contains code for\n    dealing with SLPv1 wire protocol messages and slv_v2message.c\n    contains code for dealing with SLPv2 wire protocol messages.\n    Finally slp_message.c contains code for functions common\n    to both versions of SLP wire protocol messages,\n2), in v1.2.1 the situation is slightly different. The\n    slp_v1message.c still contains function for dealing with\n    SLPv1 wire protocol messages. But slp_message.c in v1.2.1\n    contains more code.\n\nAs a result and to make this long story short, in slp_message.c\nin openslp v1.2.1 as shipped with Fedora 13, 14, and in openslp\nversion as present within EPEL-5 repository, the slp_message.c\ncontains the following function:\n\nopenslp-1.2.1/common/slp_message.c:\n867 /*--------------------------------------------------------------------------*/\n868 int ParseExtension(SLPBuffer buffer, SLPMessage message)\n869 /* Parse extensions *after* all standard protocol fields are parsed\n    */\n870 /*--------------------------------------------------------------------------*/\n\nThe code of this function seems to be noticeably similar to code,\npresent in slp_v2message.c:\n\n850 static int v2ParseExtension(SLPBuffer buffer, SLPMessage * msg)\n\nfrom upstream openslp v2.0.beta1, where this flaw was fixed.\n\nConclusion:\n===========\nRex, I think the openslp package versions, as shipped with Fedora release\nof 13 and 14, and as present within EPEL-5 repository is affected by this\nflaw too (just the particular code doesn't live in slp_v2message.c as in\nupstream v2.0.beta1 openslp version, but rather in slp_message.c and\nparticular affected routine is called:\n\n 868 int ParseExtension(SLPBuffer buffer, SLPMessage message)\n\nin Fedora's / EPEL's openslp v1.2.1 upstream based versions).\n\nSo under my opinion, the proposed upstream patch from above comment\nshould be backported to address this issue in these versions too.\n\nRex, could you have a look and confirm the above speculation?\n(and if shown to be appropriate, backport the patch and schedule\nFedora / EPEL openslp package updates?)\n\nThank you, Jan.\n--\nJan iankko Lieskovsky / Red Hat Security Response Team"
