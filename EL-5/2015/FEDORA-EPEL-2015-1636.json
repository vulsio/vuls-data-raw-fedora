From the upstream patches, relevant changes are touching mc_issue_note_update() routine, while that one doesn't seem to be available yet in mantis-1.1.8 version, as shipped with Fedora EPEL 5 (there are only mc_issue_note_add(), mc_issue_note_delete(), and mc_issue_update() ones [but 'note' is missing in the last one]).\n\n  But to be sure, could you please have a double-checking look at the proposed patch and situation in EPEL 5 version, and schedule a fix if necessary for EPEL 5 too (I am going to create a bug for this version too, since it's affected by the second bug 830737), so we would not miss something?\n\nThank you, Jan."
