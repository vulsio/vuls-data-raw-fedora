This affects PSOutputDev class used to write / convert PDF input to PS (PostScript) output.  For GUI viewers, this is done e.g. when trying to print the file.  Additionally, this requires non-default Level 1 separable PostScript language level to be used for the output file (specified via e.g. -level1sep command line option for pdftops, or psLevel configuration option in xpdfrc)."

This was fixed in the last round of xpdf fixes earlier this year as preventive fix, while other integer overflow fixes were addressed.  Upstream commit:\n\nhttp://cgit.freedesktop.org/poppler/poppler/diff/poppler/PSOutputDev.cc?id=7b2d314a61\n\nThis patch is already used in the latest poppler packages version in EL5 and gpdf version in EL4.\n\n\nCUPS does contain this code, but it is not reachable, as pdftops in CUPS never uses level1Sep PS level.  It initializes level as:\n\n119   level  = psLevel2;\n\nand later possibly changes that based on the info from the PPD file:\n\n143     level = ppd->language_level == 1 ? psLevel1 : psLevel2;\n\nEven though pdftops in CUPS reads xpdfrc-like configuration file pdftops.conf, PS output level is always set to one of the above values after reading the configuration file.  Additionally, latest CUPS packages in EL3 and EL4 have this changed to use gmallocn.\n\n\nkdegraphics' kpdf program only contains PSOutputDev in the version shipped in EL5 and is used to convert PDF to PS for printing.  kpdf does not change PS level from the default level2.  However, it does read xpdfrc configuration file used by xpdf.  Additionally, it is affected by the problem as described here:\n\nhttp://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=242930\n\nGlobalParams::GlobalParams tries to read an xpdfrc file, either one specified as its argument (kpdf passes empty string), user's local ~/.xpdfrc (xpdfUserConfigFile) or global xpdfc (xpdfUserConfigFile).  But as SYSTEM_XPDFRC is not defined, kpdf tries to open (global) xpdfrc from the current directory, instead of the expected /etc/xpdfrc.\n\nUnlike Gentoo's xpdf case, kpdf does not seem to process xpdfrc options than can lead to command execution (psFile, urlCommand, movieCommand), so does not offer a way to execute commands without exploiting some other flaw.  We should still fix this in the next kdegraphics update, possibly by completely removing an attempt to read global xpdfrc, as that never worked for kpdf.\n\n\nxpdf copy embedded in tetex contains this code too, I've not looked yet if it may be reachable though."

Their multiplication may overflow / wrap, resulting in smaller imgLine buffer allocation than expected.\n\nImageStream always uses nVals as an upper bound when writing data into imgLine.  Therefore, no buffer overflow occurs in ImageStream, but NULL pointer dereference may occur (gmallocn returns NULL when called with imgLineSize 0).\n\nPointer to imgLine is also returned out of ImageStream class instance from ImageStream::getLine() method.  Callers of the method may later over-read allocated buffer, but no caller over-writing it was identified.\n\nThis code was introduced in xpdf in some early versions (exists in 0.9x), so is likely to appear in all applications embedding / forking xpdf."
