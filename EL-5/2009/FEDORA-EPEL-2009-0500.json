Attackers who can inject deliberately malformed unicode\nstrings into the form helpers can defeat the escaping checks and inject\narbitrary HTML.\n\nVersions Affected:  2.0.0 and *all* subsequent versions.\nNot affected:       Applications running on ruby 1.9\nFixed Versions:     2.3.4, 2.2.3\nCandidate CVE:      CVE-2009-3009\n\nDue to the way that most databases either don't accept or actively\ncleanse malformed unicode strings this vulnerability is most likely to\nbe exploited by non-persistent attacks however persistent attacks may\nstill be possible in some configurations.\n\n\nThis affects rubygem-rails in Fedora 10, 11, rawhide, and EPEL 5.  Upstream versions fixing the issue for 2.2.x and 2.3.x will be available Sept 3, 2009 after the vulnerability announcement is made."

Yes, if\neveryone with an existing application goes and sets the\nRAILS_GEM_VERSION environment variable, or edits the environment.rb\nfile, their application will once again work unless it has a serious\nbug.  That's not the point.\n\nThe point is that the restriction to 2.3.2 in environment.rb is\nset up *by default* when you first run 'rails' to initialize an\napplication.  This means that anyone who has set up a rails app\non Fedora 11 will have their app stop working when they take this\nupdate, until they notice that their app has broken and go make\nthe change.  It is irresponsible for the maintainers of a package\nto push an update that pointlessly breaks most existing applications.\n\nFedora 12 is due out very soon now, and that would be the right\ntime to push a backwards-incompatible update.  You could argue that\nRails has a bug in that its default framework ties to you a hardcoded\nversion, and I'd agree with you - it should be possible to upgrade\nthe package version without breaking your application.  The software\nthat needs to be fixed is Rails, because it will break applications\non upgrade that should be perfectly compatible with the new version.\n\nThe only people who were able to successfully take the rubygem-activesupport\n2.3.3 update were the ones who don't have rubygem-rails installed,\nwhich is probably not many people, or the ones running packages out\nof updates-testing, who expect some updates to not work.  You could\nback out to 2.3.2 by bumping the epoch of the package, and I urge\nyou to consider doing so.  You've attempted to push a software version\nchange as a security update, when in fact the security patch isn't\nincluded in the version you're updating to (so you had to manually\napply it), and it applies cleanly to the version of the software\ncurrently in the release."
