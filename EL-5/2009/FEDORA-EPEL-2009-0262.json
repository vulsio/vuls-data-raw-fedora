E.g. if it is started with \"service puppetmaster start\", it still has access to all files that allow read access for the supplementary groups of root, e.g. raw disk devices.\n\nI filed an upstream bug report including patches (one needs still to be tested) here:\nhttp://projects.reductivelabs.com/issues/show/1806\n\nVersion-Release number of selected component (if applicable):\npuppet-0.24.6-1.fc10\npuupet-0.24.6-1.el5\n\nHow reproducible:\nalways\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. # service puppetmaster start\n2. # cat /proc/$(ps --User puppet -o pid | tail -n 1)/status | grep Group\n  \nActual results:\nThe output matches \"id  -G root\".\n\nExpected results:\nThe output should match \"id  -G puppet\", i.e. the process should run with the supplementary groups of puppet.\n\nThe default supplementary groups of root include the group disk, which e.g. provides raw read access on disk devices.\n\nAdditional info:\nI am not sure, whether this really classifies as a security vulnerability, because https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Security/Classifications only mentions code execution and denial of service, but imho unwanted access to restricted information is a security vulnerability, too."

If that's not possible, we can patch the puppet defaults.rb locally as a last resort.\n\nI think it's puppetmasterd that resets the mode on /var/log/puppet, as I couldn't reproduce this using only puppetd.
