After upgrading the package, browse to http://host/drupal/update.php to run the upgrade script.\r\n\r\nMultiple vulnerabilities and weaknesses were discovered in Drupal.\r\nOpenID association cross site request forgeries\r\n\r\nThe OpenID module in Drupal 6 allows users to create an account or log into a Drupal site using one or more OpenID identities.\r\n\r\nThe core OpenID module does not correctly implement Form API for the form that allows one to link user accounts with OpenID identifiers. A malicious user is therefore able to use cross site request forgeries to add attacker controlled OpenID identities to existing accounts. These OpenID identities can then be used to gain access to the affected accounts.\r\n\r\nThis issue affects Drupal 6.x only.\r\nOpenID impersonation\r\n\r\nThe OpenID module is not a compliant implementation of the OpenID Authentication 2.0 specification. An implementation error allows a user to access the account of another user when they share the same OpenID 2.0 provider.\r\n\r\nThis issue affects Drupal 6.x only.\r\nFile upload\r\n\r\nFile uploads with certain extensions are not correctly processed by the File API. This may lead to the creation of files that are executable by Apache. The .htaccess that is saved into the files directory by Drupal should normally prevent execution. The files are only executable when the server is configured to ignore the directives in the .htaccess file.\r\n\r\nThis issue affects Drupal 6.x only.\r\nSession fixation\r\n\r\nDrupal doesn't regenerate the session ID when an anonymous user follows the one time login link used to confirm email addresses and reset forgotten passwords. This enables a malicious user to fix and reuse the session id of a victim under certain circumstances.\r\n\r\nThis issue affects Drupal 5.x only.\r\nVersions affected\r\n\r\n    * Drupal 6.x before version 6.14.\r\n    * Drupal 5.x before version 5.20.\r\n\r\nSolution\r\n\r\nInstall the latest version:\r\n\r\n    * If you are running Drupal 6.x then upgrade to Drupal 6.14.\r\n    * If you are running Drupal 5.x then upgrade to Drupal 5.20.\r\n\r\nIf you are unable to upgrade immediately, you can apply a patch to secure your installation until you are able to do a proper upgrade. Theses patches fix the security vulnerabilities, but do not contain other fixes which were released in Drupal 6.14 or Drupal 5.20.\r\n\r\n    * To patch Drupal 6.13 use SA-CORE-2009-008-6.13.patch.\r\n    * To patch Drupal 5.19 use SA-CORE-2009-008-5.19.patch.\r\n\r\nImportant note: Some users using OpenID might not be able to use the existing OpenID associations to login after the upgrade. These users should use the one time login via password recovery to get access to their user account and re-add desired associations. These users likely had issues with OpenID logins prior to the upgrade.\r\nReported by\r\n\r\nThe session fixation issue was reported by Noel Sharpe.\r\nOpenID impersonation was reported by Robert Metcalf.\r\nOpenID association CSRF was reported by Heine Deelstra (*).\r\nThe file upload issue was reported by Heine Deelstra (*).\r\n\r\n(*) Member of the Drupal security team\r\nFixed by\r\n\r\nThe session fixation issue was fixed by Jakub Suchy.\r\nThe OpenID and file upload issues were fixed by Heine Deelstra.\r\nContact\r\n\r\nThe security team for Drupal can be reached at security at drupal.org or via the form at http://drupal.org/contact.",
