If you check the code path (wp-admin/includes/ WP_Upgrader->run(), fs_connect()) you can tell that it insists on asking for filesystem credentials (FTP or even SSH) before the actual file download (download_url() -> wp_remote_get()) is attempted. If checking those filesystem credentials fails it bombs out and never attempts to download the theme.\n\nThen in the 5th comment he says \"It's a matter of it being capable of replacing the files and having the file replacements have the same user and group ownership.\" He seems to be argueing the use of FTP is a convenience for when file system ownership or permissions on created files is incorrect. But no attempt is made by the application to install that downloaded file using a fwrite(), it always \"falls back\" to FTP.\n\nThis approach *forces* you to supply FTP credentials or no theme will be installed."
