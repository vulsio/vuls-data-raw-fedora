As a result,\n  several new security issues affecting Bugzilla were discovered:\n  \n  * A weakness in Bugzilla could allow a user to gain unauthorized access\n    to another Bugzilla account.\n  \n  * A weakness in the Perl CGI.pm module allows injecting HTTP headers\n    and content to users via several pages in Bugzilla.\n  \n  * The new user autocomplete functionality in Bugzilla 4.0 is vulnerable\n    to a cross-site scripting attack.\n  \n  * The new automatic duplicate detection functionality in Bugzilla 4.0\n    is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting attack.\n  \n  * If you put a harmful \"javascript:\" or \"data:\" URL into Bugzilla's\n    \"URL\" field, then there are multiple situations in which Bugzilla\n    will unintentionally make that link clickable.\n  \n  * Various pages lack protection against cross-site request forgeries.\n  \n  All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as\n  possible.\n  \n  Vulnerability Details\n  =====================\n  \n  Class:       Account Compromise\n  Versions:    2.14 to 3.2.9, 3.4.9, 3.6.3, 4.0rc1\n  Fixed In:    3.2.10, 3.4.10, 3.6.4, 4.0rc2\n  Description: It was possible for a user to gain unauthorized access to\n               any Bugzilla account in a very short amount of time (short\n               enough that the attack is highly effective).

However,\n               it does not make \"javascript:\" and \"data:\" URLs into\n               clickable links, to protect against cross-site scripting\n               attacks or other attacks. It was possible to bypass this\n               protection by adding spaces into the URL in places that\n               Bugzilla did not expect them.

Most of these issues are not as serious\n               as previous CSRF vulnerabilities. Some of these issues\n               were only addressed on more recent branches of Bugzilla\n               and not fixed in earlier branches, in order to avoid\n               changing behavior that external applications may depend\n               on.

Also, bugzilla updates to a later point releases are not transparent, you have to manually run some scripts and that is not desirable either. AFAIU, 3.2.10 is the latest in the still maintained 3.2 serie and closes all known security issues. All the patches are because I've taken all the changesets from another Fedora branch, there's no major surgery to the bugzilla code in there. Anyway, I'm not the maintainer for bugzilla, I just thought it might help him bite the bullet and fix all those nasty CVEs."

As such I'm not sure which build you tested.\nAnyway, it's not pushed to testing because I hadn't had time to do thorough testing. the 3.2 branch is not supported by upstream anymore and I had to backport a number of fixes. Actually, I think the build would rather be in testing than in koji, so I'm going to push it there."

If I enable only the updates-testing repo and do a 'yum list bugzilla' I don't get any hits either, so I think that's right.\n\nIt was this build I pulled from koji and smoke-tested.\n\nThe way I personally evaluate this is that there are /known/ problems (disclosed security ones at that). There may also be problems with your patches (thank you for backporting!) but we don't know that, so better to err on the side of getting the security updates out, and then fixing the unknown problems if reported.\n\nOther people might reasonably take the more cautious approach, especially if their bugzilla isn't Internet-facing.  I don't know if Fedora offers guidance on which way to lean."

This alternate host is now also used when viewing\n             patches in \"Raw Unified\" mode because Internet Explorer 8\n             and older, and Safari before 5.0.6 do content sniffing,\n             which could lead to the execution of malicious code.\nReferences:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=637981\nCVE Number:  CVE-2011-2379\n\nClass:       Information Leak\nVersions:    2.23.3 to 3.4.11, 3.5.1 to 3.6.5, 3.7.1 to 4.0.1,\n             4.1.1 to 4.1.2\nFixed In:    3.4.12, 3.6.6, 4.0.2, 4.1.3\nDescription: Normally, a group name is confidential and is only visible\n             to members of the group, and to non-members if the group\n             is used in bugs. By crafting the URL when creating or\n             editing a bug, it was possible to guess if a group existed\n             or not, even for groups which weren't used in bugs and so\n             which were supposed to remain confidential.\n             Moreover, in Bugzilla 4.1.1 and 4.1.2, custom searches also\n             let you determine if a group exists or not, even for groups\n             which should remain confidential.\nReferences:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=653477\n             https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=674497\nCVE Number:  CVE-2011-2380, CVE-2011-2979\n\nClass:       Email Header Injection\nVersions:    2.17.1 to 3.4.11, 3.5.1 to 3.6.5, 3.7.1 to 4.0.1,\n             4.1.1 to 4.1.2\nFixed In:    3.4.12, 3.6.6, 4.0.2, 4.1.3\nDescription: Bugzilla mostly sends two types of email notifications:\n             bugmails and flagmails. A bugmail is the standard email\n             users get when a change is made to a bug. A flagmail is\n             only sent to the requestee or requester of a flag. For\n             flagmails only, attachment descriptions with a newline\n             in them could lead to the injection of crafted headers in\n             email notifications when an attachment flag is edited.\n             Other users only receiving a bugmail are not affected.\nReferences:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=657158\nCVE Number:  CVE-2011-2381\n\nClass:       Unnotified Account Change\nVersions:    2.16rc1 to 3.4.11, 3.5.1 to 3.6.5, 3.7.1 to 4.0.1,\n             4.1.1 to 4.1.2\nFixed In:    3.4.12, 3.6.6, 4.0.2, 4.1.3\nDescription: When a user changes his email address, Bugzilla trusts\n             a user-modifiable field for obtaining the current e-mail\n             address to send a confirmation message to. If an attacker\n             has access to the session of another user (for example,\n             if that user left their browser window open in a public\n             place), the attacker could alter this field to cause\n             the email-change notification to go to their own address.\n             This means that the user would not be notified that his\n             account had its email address changed by the attacker.\nReferences:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=670868\nCVE Number:  CVE-2011-2978\n\nClass:       Local Information Disclosure\nVersions:    3.6 to 3.6.5, 3.7.1 to 4.0.1, 4.1.1 to 4.1.2\nFixed In:    3.6.6, 4.0.2, 4.1.3\nDescription: Temporary files for uploaded attachments are not deleted\n             on Windows. A user with local access to the server could\n             read these attachments even if he wouldn't normally be\n             allowed to view them from Bugzilla.\nReferences:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=660502\nCVE Number:  CVE-2011-2977\n\nClass:       Cross-Site Scripting\nVersions:    2.16rc1 to 3.4.11\nFixed In:    3.4.12\nDescription: If a BUGLIST cookie is compromised (which is not possible\n             except via a vulnerability outside of Bugzilla), it can be\n             used to inject HTML code when viewing a bug report, leading\n             to a cross-site scripting attack.\n             Bugzilla 3.5.1 and above are not affected by this issue.\nReferences:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=660053\nCVE Number:  CVE-2011-2976\n\n[1] http://www.bugzilla.org/security/3.4.11/\n\nFedora has 3.6.6 currently in testing, but EPEL6 has 3.4.11 in testing and EPEL4/5 are shipping old versions (3.2.4); they should all be updated to 3.4.12 to correct these flaws."
