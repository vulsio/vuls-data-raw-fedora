						"thetext": "Older versions of nginx suffer from a flaw where a NULL byte in a URI was handled improperly in some modules, such as with the FastCGI server.  If an attacker were able to upload a file to the PHP-FCGI server with a crafted filename such as file.jpg%00.php, the NULL byte could cause all data after the NULL byte to be discarded.  In this case, uploading file.jpg%00.php would cause PHP-FCGI, for instance, to parse the file as a PHP file, which could lead to artbitrary code execution on sites where files could be uploaded.\n\nThis was previously reported to the Ubuntu bug tracker [1] and has been fixed in nginx r3528.  This would affect nginx versions 0.5, 0.6, 0.7 < 0.7.66, and 0.8 < 0.8.38.\n\n[1] https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nginx/+bug/783508"

						"thetext": "[I'm the original reporter]\n\nJust to clarify, this issue does not involve uploading files containing NULL bytes in their name. Instead, it has to do with how NULL bytes in URLs are handled by nginx.\n\nThe default configuration for PHP-FCGI involves a location block that looks for requests with URLs ending in .php and passes those requests onto the PHP-FCGI handler. In vulnerable versions of nginx, an attacker can cause any file accessible on the server to be executed as PHP by making a request with a URL ending in %00.php. Behind the scenes, nginx notices the .php extension at the end of the request and passes it along to the PHP-FCGI handler. However, the %00.php suffix is ignored by PHP-FCGI due to the NULL byte, which allows the real file to be loaded and parsed. That leads to arbitrary code execution on sites where an attacker can upload a publicly accessible file to the server."
