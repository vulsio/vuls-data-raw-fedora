A new patch has been developed, and is\ncurrently pending review and acceptance by the primary CGI.pm author,\nLincoln Stein. (Now CC'ed).\n\n> >        Steve, could you please allocate CVE id for this?

I submitted a patch, but it has not\nbeen applied, as seen in the Network view:\n\nhttps://github.com/markstos/CGI--Simple/network\n\nHowever, even the patch I submitted is not fully complete, as it mirrors\nthe 3.50 state of CGI.pm, and thus also needs further work. Once CGI.pm\nhas a final update to address the remaining header injection issue, I'll\nshare the same patch with CGI::Simple.\n\n    Mark\n\n===========================================================\n\nYet, reply from Reed Loden of Mozilla Security Group:\n[3] http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2010/12/01/2"
