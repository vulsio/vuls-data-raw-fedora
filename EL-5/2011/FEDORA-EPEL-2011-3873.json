As a result,\n  several new security issues affecting Bugzilla were discovered:\n  \n  * A weakness in Bugzilla could allow a user to gain unauthorized access\n    to another Bugzilla account.\n  \n  * A weakness in the Perl CGI.pm module allows injecting HTTP headers\n    and content to users via several pages in Bugzilla.\n  \n  * The new user autocomplete functionality in Bugzilla 4.0 is vulnerable\n    to a cross-site scripting attack.\n  \n  * The new automatic duplicate detection functionality in Bugzilla 4.0\n    is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting attack.\n  \n  * If you put a harmful \"javascript:\" or \"data:\" URL into Bugzilla's\n    \"URL\" field, then there are multiple situations in which Bugzilla\n    will unintentionally make that link clickable.\n  \n  * Various pages lack protection against cross-site request forgeries.\n  \n  All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as\n  possible.\n  \n  Vulnerability Details\n  =====================\n  \n  Class:       Account Compromise\n  Versions:    2.14 to 3.2.9, 3.4.9, 3.6.3, 4.0rc1\n  Fixed In:    3.2.10, 3.4.10, 3.6.4, 4.0rc2\n  Description: It was possible for a user to gain unauthorized access to\n               any Bugzilla account in a very short amount of time (short\n               enough that the attack is highly effective). This is a\n               critical vulnerability that should be patched immediately\n               by all Bugzilla installations.\n  References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=621591\n               https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=619594\n  CVE Number:  CVE-2010-4568\n  \n  Class:       HTTP Response Splitting\n  Versions:    Every Version Before 3.2.10, 3.4.10, 3.6.4, 4.0rc2\n  Fixed In:    3.2.10, 3.4.10, 3.6.4, 4.0rc2\n  Description: By inserting particular strings into certain URLs, it was\n               possible to inject both headers and content to any\n               browser.\n  References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=591165\n               https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=621572\n               http://avatraxiom.livejournal.com/104105.html\n               http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/113.html\n  CVE Number:  CVE-2010-2761, CVE-2010-4411, CVE-2010-4572\n  \n  Class:       Cross-Site Scripting\n  Versions:    3.7.1 to 4.0rc1\n  Fixed In:    4.0rc2\n  Description: Bugzilla 3.7.x and 4.0rc1 have a new client-side\n               autocomplete mechanism for all fields where a username\n               is entered.

However,\n               it does not make \"javascript:\" and \"data:\" URLs into\n               clickable links, to protect against cross-site scripting\n               attacks or other attacks. It was possible to bypass this\n               protection by adding spaces into the URL in places that\n               Bugzilla did not expect them.

Most of these issues are not as serious\n               as previous CSRF vulnerabilities. Some of these issues\n               were only addressed on more recent branches of Bugzilla\n               and not fixed in earlier branches, in order to avoid\n               changing behavior that external applications may depend\n               on.

Also, bugzilla updates to a later point releases are not transparent, you have to manually run some scripts and that is not desirable either. AFAIU, 3.2.10 is the latest in the still maintained 3.2 serie and closes all known security issues. All the patches are because I've taken all the changesets from another Fedora branch, there's no major surgery to the bugzilla code in there. Anyway, I'm not the maintainer for bugzilla, I just thought it might help him bite the bullet and fix all those nasty CVEs."

As such I'm not sure which build you tested.\nAnyway, it's not pushed to testing because I hadn't had time to do thorough testing. the 3.2 branch is not supported by upstream anymore and I had to backport a number of fixes. Actually, I think the build would rather be in testing than in koji, so I'm going to push it there."

If I enable only the updates-testing repo and do a 'yum list bugzilla' I don't get any hits either, so I think that's right.\n\nIt was this build I pulled from koji and smoke-tested.\n\nThe way I personally evaluate this is that there are /known/ problems (disclosed security ones at that). There may also be problems with your patches (thank you for backporting!) but we don't know that, so better to err on the side of getting the security updates out, and then fixing the unknown problems if reported.\n\nOther people might reasonably take the more cautious approach, especially if their bugzilla isn't Internet-facing.  I don't know if Fedora offers guidance on which way to lean."
