Not very surprisingly, reported attack vectors use either\nabsolute paths or paths with '..'s.  Such path can be used in file/directory\nname or in (directory) symlink.  Additionally, there were some issues specific\nto implementation of the checks ('/../' detected correctly, but not '//../').\n\n\n. symlinks linking to just \"..\" work (can be used repeatedly to walk up the tree).\n\nGood point.  You seem to be right with that.\n\n. symlinks pointing to absolute paths can't be used.\n\nAll \"suspicious\" symlinks are ignored / not extracted.\n\n. path checking doesn't check for either \"./../foo\" or \"xyz/../../foo\" type attacks.\n\nIt does.  Patch is using normpath() to normalize paths, hence both of your\nexample paths get normalized to: ../foo and are tested after normalization.\n\n. I'm pretty sure self._check_path(os.path.join(tarinfo.name, tarinfo.linkname))\nis wrong, I think they meant \"current path inside the tarfile\" not \"path of\nsymlink\" ... so that \"foo.html -> ../src/foo.html\" works if the link is in a\ndocs directory.\n\nYes, that part seems to be incorrect...  I assume tarinfo.name is\ndir/in/tarfile/symlink.  So in your example tarinfo.name would be docs/foo.html\nand join + normpath would yield docs/src/foo.html ... not correct.\n\n\nCurrent upstream opinion seems to be that module's behavior conforms to\nstandards and it just should not be used to extract archives from untrusted sources.\n"

So people might treat that as a regression. But, yeh, it's also possible\npeople have a use for tarfiles with symlinks to ../foo in them.\n\n> . path checking doesn't check for either \"./../foo\" or \"xyz/../../foo\" type\nattacks.\n> It does.

Not very surprisingly, reported attack vectors use either\nabsolute paths or paths with '..'s.  Such path can be used in file/directory\nname or in (directory) symlink.  Additionally, there were some issues specific\nto implementation of the checks ('/../' detected correctly, but not '//../').\n\n\n. symlinks linking to just \"..\" work (can be used repeatedly to walk up the tree).\n\nGood point.  You seem to be right with that.\n\n. symlinks pointing to absolute paths can't be used.\n\nAll \"suspicious\" symlinks are ignored / not extracted.\n\n. path checking doesn't check for either \"./../foo\" or \"xyz/../../foo\" type attacks.\n\nIt does.  Patch is using normpath() to normalize paths, hence both of your\nexample paths get normalized to: ../foo and are tested after normalization.\n\n. I'm pretty sure self._check_path(os.path.join(tarinfo.name, tarinfo.linkname))\nis wrong, I think they meant \"current path inside the tarfile\" not \"path of\nsymlink\" ... so that \"foo.html -> ../src/foo.html\" works if the link is in a\ndocs directory.\n\nYes, that part seems to be incorrect...  I assume tarinfo.name is\ndir/in/tarfile/symlink.  So in your example tarinfo.name would be docs/foo.html\nand join + normpath would yield docs/src/foo.html ... not correct.\n\n\nCurrent upstream opinion seems to be that module's behavior conforms to\nstandards and it just should not be used to extract archives from untrusted sources.\n"

So people might treat that as a regression. But, yeh, it's also possible\npeople have a use for tarfiles with symlinks to ../foo in them.\n\n> . path checking doesn't check for either \"./../foo\" or \"xyz/../../foo\" type\nattacks.\n> It does.
