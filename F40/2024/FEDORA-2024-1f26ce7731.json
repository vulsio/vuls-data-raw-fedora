That\nis probably what could be considered as the bigger security issue because it would make\nIPv6 packet movement able to be controlled by a malicious attacker who knows what the\nrules look like.\n\nSecond, there is an issue with the OpenFlow spec that doesn't specify required matching\non both icmp_type and icmp_code, rather it only specifies icmp_type as the required\nmatch - however, that is really a bug. ICMP type and code are required to properly flag\na neighbor discovery packet. Our products, and most products afaik will generate matches\non both icmp_type and icmp_code, so for most deployments, it won't likely be hit.\nHowever, I recently did post a possible workaround to the ovs security mailing list and\nwe are debating the right way to implement the workaround. Unfortunately, because it is\nreally an issue with the spec, we need to make a decision and hope that a future\nversion of the spec doesn't make our fix incompatible, so there is some discussion.\n\nWhen the icmp_type + icmp_code masking patch gets accepted, I'll update this bz."
