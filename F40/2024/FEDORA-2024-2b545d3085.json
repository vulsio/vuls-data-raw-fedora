One of them is an \"interactive\" style node and interact with users.  All of them were initially Fedora 36 and have been updated through the years to 39.  They are all MSDOS partitions of virtualized block devices.  On 7 of them /boot is on the same partition as /, on the 1 /boot is a separate partition.\n\nAll of them experienced this problem."

Unmount the disks and set the filesystem UUID of \"disk01-new\" to match \"disk01\" using \"xfs_admin -U <UID> /dev/vdd1\".  This is so I can boot from it without changing fstab.\n7.

						"thetext": "Hi Shane, Nicolas and Marta,\n\nI believe I'm running into this same bug on my machine. It also seems to be the same as the one discussed in this post:\n\nhttps://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/grub-broken-after-upgrade-to-f38/100319\n\nI'm running F39, initially a F35 netinstall upgraded with dnf, with a separate /boot XFS partition and MBR. I ran grub2-install (2.06-110) after upgrading from F38 to F39.\n\nI thought it was failing to boot, but after reading that Fedora Discussion post, I managed to get to the boot menu and boot after holding the spacebar to skip some 40 pages of\nerror: ../../grub-core/fs/xfs.c:541:not a correct inode\n\nI already ran xfs_repair on /boot from a live USB and it seems OK.\n\nIf one of you is able to test that it reaches the boot menu by scrolling down the pages, we can find out if it's the same issue. I haven't tested it yet, but\nset pager=0\nin grub.cfg might save you some keystrokes.\n\nI had to type some of the log out, since I couldn't find a way to dump it, and I'll send it as an attachment. There might be some typos.\n\nThe error comes from fs/xfs.c:grub_xfs_read_inode trying to check some magic number for an inode with (ino = 0, block = 0, offset = 0) while opening a file. It looks like it gets stuck in a loop before reaching a timeout after over 250 attempts and then resumes and opens the file properly.\n\nNote that some files don't raise this error. Every grub2/i386-pc/*.mod seems to do, but grub2/grubenv doesn't. It probably has to do with directory traversal and the number of files in a directory, I think, and since xfsprogs-6.5.0 seems to make it disappear, it might be because it fails to check for an older layout. In particular, my partition has nrext64=0, which is related to the latest patches regarding extent parsing.\n\n# xfs_info /dev/sda1\nmeta-data=/dev/sda1              isize=512    agcount=4, agsize=65536 blks\n         =                       sectsz=512   attr=2, projid32bit=1\n         =                       crc=1        finobt=1, sparse=1, rmapbt=0\n         =                       reflink=1    bigtime=0 inobtcount=0 nrext64=0\ndata     =                       bsize=4096   blocks=262144, imaxpct=25\n         =                       sunit=0      swidth=0 blks\nnaming   =version 2              bsize=4096   ascii-ci=0, ftype=1\nlog      =internal log           bsize=4096   blocks=2560, version=2\n         =                       sectsz=512   sunit=0 blks, lazy-count=1\nrealtime =none                   extsz=4096   blocks=0, rtextents=0\n\n\nAlso Shane, you can setup early debug logging if you install it with this hidden flag: \ngrub2-install --debug-image=all /dev/...\nIt still skips some early errors, but it will you give some more info before reaching your grub.cfg. It makes it very verbose, though."

Won't it be required at one point? But what is the solution? Recreate the partition with xfsprog >= 6.5.0?\nThe problem is that even if I remove /boot from fstab (and /boot is not mounted), mkfs.xfs still tells me that the partition is in use, even though it is not and no processes are accessing it (checked with lsof and whatnot). One of my machines is in a DC and HP's remote console is not that great, so booting up with a LiveCD could be rather tricky.\n\nCheers,\n  K. C."

Sometimes even the remote console does not work. Which is why I added an ssh server to my initramfs so that I can decrypt my / when booting up without having to use the remote console.\nBut maybe I can visit the DC at one point...\n\n> A manual workaround....\n\nHowever, I can try your workaround on my Proxmox.

						"thetext": "Sorry I'm a little late to the party. I just found out about the bug report.\n\nSo to start with:\n1. Big thanks to Shane for that disk image\n2. None of the bugs have anything to do with the version of xfsprogs used to create the filesystem.\n\nThis bug is caused by a directory entry being structured like this: (The output is what xfs_db shows for the directry entry for /boot/grub2/i386-pc from the fedora39-110.qcow2.xz image)\n\nu3.bmx[0-3] = [startoff,startblock,blockcount,extentflag]\n0:[0,8461707,1,0]\n1:[1,8498650,1,0]\n2:[3,9638708,1,0]\n3:[8388608,8461706,1,0]\n\n(Note: Don't worry about extent #3 with block #8388608. That is leaf information that GRUB's parser almost entirely ignores.)\n\nSo there are 3 valid data blocks 0, 1, and 3. But GRUB's iterator code doesn't parse this extent list, it actually infers the number of data blocks from the inode.size field. This inference includes the unmapped data blocks like block #2: (Although it excludes the leaf blocks like #8388608)\n\nxfs_db> dblock 2\nfile data block is unmapped\n\nSo when GRUB reads this directory it proceeds to iterate over blocks 0, 1, 2, and 3. The original XFS parser ended up skipping this unmapped data block as a side effect of its attempt to incorrectly read leaf information from the end of the data block. When I fixed the code that was incorrectly parsing the leaf information, I unknowingly removed the only code preventing GRUB from trying to parse unmapped data blocks.\n\nAssuming GRUB returns a zero'ed block of memory for the unmapped data block, the fix could be as simple as checking each block for the magic number. (Warning: there are at least four cromulent magic numbers.) If GRUB is returning garbage data for the unmapped data block then the fix is going to be much more complicated.\n\n(In reply to Adam Williamson from comment #56)\n> I suspect the fix for this causes\n> https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2259266 - BIOS boot from XFS\n> /boot is broken, at least on qemu, in Rawhide.\n\nyes, reverting this patch will cause a different XFS parser bug. If Fedora wishes to revert the patch they need to also revert the original fuzzer patch (https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/grub.git/commit/grub-core/fs/xfs.c?id=ef7850c757fb3dd2462a512cfa0ff19c89fcc0b1) and probably the other followup fix (https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/grub.git/commit/grub-core/fs/xfs.c?id=ad7fb8e2e02bb1dd0475ead9919c1c82514d2ef8) for it as well."

I should have pulled you into this discussion much sooner. \n\nAFAIK, removing your patch from rawhide was only meant as a temporary fix to mitigate the issues people are seeing. It seems that the patch should not be backported (at least in its current state) to f38 and f39, as this bug indicates, but really does need to be in rawhide because otherwise: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2259266 Based on testing that we did last week on VMs, it appeared that the patch was causing problems on rawhide as well, but the behavior of VMs (that Nicolas and I have been using to test) is different than what people are reporting. For us, the VMs just go down and then we don't see any output / serial console, no errors, nothing. They just hang. We will make sure to test on bare metal from now on as well.\n\nNicolas is out this week, but we can try to make some progress anyway in the meantime..? You know much more about xfs than either of us do, so your input is certainly welcome. (:\n\nthanks again."
