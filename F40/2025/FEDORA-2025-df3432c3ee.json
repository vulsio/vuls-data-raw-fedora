The second one is better for already released versions of RHEL as it's safer because it does not bring unintended changes along the way.\n\nThis CVE is an example of that. As you can see here: https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:5534, we have backported the patch to the build you've mentioned. Because it's not a rebase, there is no need to change the package's version.\n\nWhen verifying whether a vulnerability is fixed in one of Red Hat's components, checking just the version number is not enough. You can either search for released advisories or check the changelog of the package you have installed:\n\n[root@df0ea19337a7 /]# rpm -qv python3-setuptools\npython3-setuptools-53.0.0-12.el9_4.1.noarch\n\n[root@df0ea19337a7 /]# rpm -q --changelog python3-setuptools\n* Wed Jul 24 2024 Lumír Balhar <lbalhar@redhat.com> - 53.0.0-12.1\n- Security fix for CVE-2024-6345\nResolves: RHEL-50466\n\n* Wed Jan 11 2023 Charalampos Stratakis <cstratak@redhat.com> - 53.0.0-12\n- Security fix for CVE-2022-40897\nResolves: rhbz#2158559\n…\n\nHope this helps."

To put it\n> more directly...\n\nAfter the version number, we have something called a release number with a dist tag. When building something new for the future minor version we bump the release number and the dist tag is el9 in this case. So the fixed version in RHEL 9.5 will be python-setuptools-53.0.0-13.el9\nBecause we have to preserve the upgrade path between minor releases, we don't usually bump the release when building something for already released RHEL (9.4 in this case). Also, the dist tag for releases already out contains both major and minor number: el9_4. So, for RHEL 9.4, instead of going from -12.el9_4 to -13.el9_4, we use -12.el9_4.1. That way, even if the version is the same, the release numbers in newer RHEL releases are always higher and a downgrade or a regression during upgrades cannot happen.\n\n> 2) If I have \"python3-setuptools-wheel-53.0.0-12.el9.noarch\" and\n> \"python3-setuptools-53.0.0-12.el9.noarch\" installed... do I have this item\n> patched, or not?  It IS version 53.0.0-12, but it does not include the 4.1,\n> and that's the version mentioned in the RHSA you pointed me to.\n\nNo, your version is vulnerable. It depends on the system you are using. If it's RHEL 9.4, you should upgrade to the version mentioned in the RHSA. If you are running Centos Stream, the patched version python-setuptools-53.0.0-13.el9 is already available. Another possibility is to upgrade to RHEL 9.5 once available.\n\n> 3) Is any of this written down somewhere that's not a Bugzilla comment? \n> Like if I have a team member coming onboard and I need to instruct them\n> about how to apply this analysis when creating containers, is there a docs\n> page or manual page I can point them to that indicates that RHSAs are\n> covering these issues for RedHat's copy of Python3?\n\nNothing I know about, sorry. But I'm an engineer and the questions about the documentation are better for customer support. But you can find something online, for example: https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/advisory/\n\n> 4) Is it fair to interpret things that apply to RedHat 9 as also applying to\n> RedHat's UBI 9 base image? Always?\n\nYes. UBI content is based on what's going into RHEL. Always.\n\n> 5) This is not a major concern but a curiosity: why is RedHat sticking with\n> setuptools v53 when this package is now up to 75\n> (https://pypi.org/project/setuptools/)?

If you want more fresh software, we are working on the new setuptools for Fedora Linux. A very simplified promise might sound like: You can install our enterprise distro and your applications on top, and we promise to keep it stable without breaking backward compatibility while still fixing security vulnerabilities for years. Of course there are many nuances and different levels of support etc. That's the reason for backporting patches rather than upgrading to the latest versions - when you backport a patch to fix a security vulnerability, the risk of breaking something is much smaller than when you upgrade.\n\nThis discussion seems to be helpful but I'm not sure it's interesting for all recipients of notifications of this bug so if you have any more questions, feel free to send me an e-mail."
