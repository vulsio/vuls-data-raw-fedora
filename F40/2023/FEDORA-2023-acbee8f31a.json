The data was generated solely from koji buildroot, so it might be newer than the latest compose or the content on mirrors. To reproduce, use the koji/local repo only, e.g. in mock:\n\n    $ mock -r fedora-40-x86_64 --config-opts mirrored=False install mcrouter\n\n\nP.P.S. If this bug has been reported in the middle of upgrading multiple dependent packages, please consider using side tags: https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fesco/Updates_Policy/#updating-inter-dependent-packages\n\nThanks!"
