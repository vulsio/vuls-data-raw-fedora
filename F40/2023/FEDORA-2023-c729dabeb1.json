(The _pwdgrp_cffi.pypy38-pp73-x86_64-linux-gnu.so-7.3.7-1.fc34.x86_64.debug file has no .debug_info* sections.)\n\nWhile a local fix for this may be beneficial, I believe it'd be ALSO good\nto get /usr/bin/find-debuginfo to add a seed by default.

And maybe make the rpm install warnings a little easier to interpret (those conflicting files are symlinks, the target is the binary with the conflicting build-id). So if the warning could (also) print the target of that symlink that would be really helpful.\n\nAdding an extra, known to really be different, seed to the build-id calculation would mean we miss these bugs.\nUnless these kind of bugs are widespread and really hard to fix."

Across all of fedora 32+,\nthere are some 370,000 duplicate buildids between debuginfo-carrying files in\ndifferent rpms or different files in the same rpm.  That is so many that it's\nnot practical to even analyze all the cases.  Just a random set of categories:\n\n(a) duplicate binaries across different n-v-r's\n  - glibc /usr/lib/gconv/*.so binaries identical across several releases\n  - glibc benchtests binaries, ditto\n  - pypy3.7 and pypy3.8 so's identical\n  - gcc /usr/libexec/.../vet\n  - hdf libmfhdf.so\n  - cheese .dwz files (but not binaries!)\n  - dyninst tests\n\n(b) not-really-problems: subpackages from a single n-v-r build duplicating binaries under different names\n  - java subpackages include dupe binaries in different subdirs\n  - crossgcc holy cow so many identical binaries for different targets\n  - graphviz including php/tcl .so's in different subdirs\n  - quantum-espresso with identical /usr/bin/*.x_binary files\n  - charliecloud test .sos copied with multiple prefixes (not hardlinked)\n  - binutils ld & ld.gold (copied, not hardlinked)\n\n(c) rust binaries\n  - it seems as though stripping / -g compilation works differently enough that\n    debuginfod considers /usr/bin/FOO and /usr/lib/debug/usr/bin/FOO.debug the same|\n\n(d) non-problems - same binary included in more than one subrpm from a build\n\n(e) OTHER UNKNOWN SITUATIONS that I didn't notice, because the report is so big\n\n\nOf these, the (a) case could be fixed with automatic n-v-r.a based buildid salting."

The behavior of urlparse and urlsplit functions is documented well and those functions are not intended to validate URLs. Therefore the upstream point of view is that the vulnerability is not in Python but might be in apps using these functions incorrectly.\n\nBecause the urllib module does not strictly follow any standard or RFC, it's almost impossible to do any backward-incompatible changes there.\n\nWe are trying to come up with a plan how to improve urllib module in Python in a way that would be future-proof, won't break backward compatibility, will be easily backportable into our systems and components and will be acceptable to upstream.\n\nI'm also gonna open a discussion with the product security team about the severity and our point of view."
