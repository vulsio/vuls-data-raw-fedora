If you don't have time to maintain this package, consider orphaning it, so maintainers of dependent packages realize the problem.\n\n\nIf you don't react accordingly to the policy for FTBFS/FTI bugs (https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fesco/Fails_to_build_from_source_Fails_to_install/), your package may be orphaned in 8+ weeks.\n\n\nP.S. The data was generated solely from koji buildroot, so it might be newer than the latest compose or the content on mirrors. To reproduce, use the koji/local repo only, e.g. in mock:\n\n    $ mock -r fedora-39-x86_64 --config-opts mirrored=False install golang-github-nats-io-server-devel\n\n\nP.P.S. If this bug has been reported in the middle of upgrading multiple dependent packages, please consider using side tags: https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fesco/Updates_Policy/#updating-inter-dependent-packages\n\nThanks!"

If you don't have time to maintain this package, consider orphaning it, so maintainers of dependent packages realize the problem.\n\n\nIf you don't react accordingly to the policy for FTBFS/FTI bugs (https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fesco/Fails_to_build_from_source_Fails_to_install/), your package may be orphaned in 8+ weeks.\n\n\nP.S. The data was generated solely from koji buildroot, so it might be newer than the latest compose or the content on mirrors. To reproduce, use the koji/local repo only, e.g. in mock:\n\n    $ mock -r fedora-39-x86_64 --config-opts mirrored=False install golang-github-nats-io-server-devel\n\n\nP.P.S. If this bug has been reported in the middle of upgrading multiple dependent packages, please consider using side tags: https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fesco/Updates_Policy/#updating-inter-dependent-packages\n\nThanks!"
