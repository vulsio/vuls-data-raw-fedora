Install \"caca-utils\"\n2. Ensure that \"toilet\" package is not installed\n3. Start cacaclock\n\nActual results:\n\ncacaclock does not start and throws \"Could not open font\"\n\nExpected results:\n\ncacaclock should start and work\n\nAdditional info:\n\nUnless I am looking at the wrong version, failure seems to happen here (http://caca.zoy.org/browser/libcaca/trunk/src/cacaclock.c?rev=4806#L122) while trying to load font at \"/usr/share/figlet/mono12.tlf\" as per here (http://caca.zoy.org/browser/libcaca/trunk/src/cacaclock.c?rev=4806#L72)"
