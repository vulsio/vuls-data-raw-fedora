After the update the following vars are always dupes in settings.json except the \"withheld\" passwords that are always new randomly generated.\n\n    \"rpc-password\": \"<withheld>\",\n    \"rpc-password\": \"<withheld>\",\n    \"rpc-port\": 9091,\n    \"rpc-port\": 9091,\n    \"rpc-url\": \"/transmission/\",\n    \"rpc-url\": \"/transmission/\",\n    \"rpc-username\": \"\",\n    \"rpc-username\": \"\",\n    \"rpc-whitelist\": \"127.0.0.1\",\n    \"rpc-whitelist\": \"127.0.0.1\",\n    \"rpc-whitelist-enabled\": true,\n    \"rpc-whitelist-enabled\": true,\n\n\nIf I remove the dupes or change ny of the lines, new dupes are either created, or the lines are over-written.\n\nVersion-Release number of selected component (if applicable):\ntransmission-2.92-11.fc27\n\nHow reproducible:\nAlways\n\nHow to reproduce:\n1. install transmission-2.92-11.fc27\n2. edit the whitelist or disable whitelist in settings.json\n3. start the daemon\n4. try to access the daemon over network\n5. verify how the whitelist looks\n\n\nActual results:\nmy conf (in Expected results) are overwritten on daemon restart with following:\n    \"rpc-password\": \"<withheld>\",\n    \"rpc-password\": \"<withheld>\",\n    \"rpc-port\": 9091,\n    \"rpc-port\": 9091,\n    \"rpc-url\": \"/transmission/\",\n    \"rpc-url\": \"/transmission/\",\n    \"rpc-username\": \"\",\n    \"rpc-username\": \"\",\n    \"rpc-whitelist\": \"127.0.0.1\",\n    \"rpc-whitelist\": \"127.0.0.1\",\n    \"rpc-whitelist-enabled\": true,\n    \"rpc-whitelist-enabled\": true,\n\n\nExpected results:\n    \"rpc-password\": \"<withheld>\",\n    \"rpc-port\": 9091,\n    \"rpc-url\": \"/transmission/\",\n    \"rpc-username\": \"\",\n    \"rpc-whitelist\": \"127.0.0.1,10.88.*.*\",\n    \"rpc-whitelist-enabled\": true,\n\n\nAdditional info:\nEven when I get the rpc-whitelist-enabled to say false, I still get 403 from the daemon, with comments in the web-ui about blocked by missing IP in whitelist."
