When doing the same test with mbed TLS, it is a very different story.\n\nThe quick answer is: The current state is that the mbed TLS implementation in OpenVPN does _not_ support --pkcs12.  This is something I was not aware of.  When looking at the mbed TLS API, it seems to be quite a bit more work to implement the missing pieces for PKCS#12 support.\n\nTomorrow I will get in touch with some guys knowing the mbed TLS implementation far better.  Perhaps we can put down a plan to resolve this.  But I can not make any promises now.\n\nThe short version of why we've switched to mbed TLS in F26 is that F26 want to ship with openssl-1.1.  OpenVPN is not prepared for that yet (Only ~50% if the contributed patches to make this work is reviewed and applied to the upstream OpenVPN tree)  So in the mean time it was decided to ship an OpenVPN built against mbed TLS instead - knowing it was not 100% feature compatible with the OpenSSL builds.  But it would be better with a reduced OpenVPN than no OpenVPN.  \n\nOnce OpenVPN can build against OpenSSL 1.1, I will switch back.  But right now, that isn't an option."

						"thetext": "I have checked this more carefully now.  The mbed TLS library completely lacks support for PKCS#12 files.  Which makes it impossible to make use of those files as it is today.  There are some partial PKCS#12 support, but that only covers password encryption used in PKCS#8 private keys and not the PKCS#12 file container.  So I am sorry to say that the mbed TLS library and PKCS#12 files is currently a dead-end.\n\nOn the other hand, I have recently discovered the compat-openssl10.  But that breaks PKCS#11 support, as there are package conflicts between openssl-devel and compat-openssl10-devel when installing the needed pkcs11-helper-devel package.\n\nSo currently, I have the options of:  a)  Keep mbed TLS builds and break PKCS#12, or b) Switch to compat-openssl10 and break PKCS#11 smart card support.\n\nTo be honest ... I have no idea which path is the least painful for most of the users.  Had I known that, I'd do a decision right now.\n\nI have reached out to Tomas Mraz (openssl/compat-openssl10 maintainer) and Kalev Lember (pkcs11-helper maintainer) to see if we can find a way to avoid the pkcs11-helper situation.  If that is doable, I will soon switch back to OpenSSL again."

If it is, I will prefer PKCS#11 support over PKCS#12.  The reason for that is that PKCS#11 have a workaround (you can split that file up into CA, Certificate and Private Key files using the \"openssl pkcs12\" command).\n\nIf however PKCS#11 support is _not_ functional with mbed TLS, I will switch to build OpenVPN against compat-openssl10 without PKCS#11 support.

We (upstream OpenVPN) will not do anything additionally in OpenVPN to support MD5 any more.  The MD5 verification support must be present in the SSL library for OpenVPN; then it will work as before.  But we DO NOT support MD5 in OpenVPN any more.  And OpenSSL (and other SSL libraries) do make it more and more harder to re-enable MD5 based certificate verification support.\n\nMore information can be seen in https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1498322#c1\n\nTL;DR: Don't use MD5 based certificates.  Period.  If your VPN provider enforces you to do so; don't use that VPN.  Really.  MD5 is broken beyond repair and it has been like that for over 12 years(!).  Time to move on.\n\nAnd\n- no, I will not change my mind.\n- yes, what we did here in this ticket was a big mistake."
