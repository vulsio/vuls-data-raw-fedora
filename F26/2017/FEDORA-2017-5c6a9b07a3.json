The ultimate effect of\nthis would be for maptrack entries for a single domain to be re-used.\n\nIMPACT\n======\n\nFor the first issue, for a short window of time, a malicious backend\ncould still read and write memory that the frontend thought was its\nown again.  Depending on the usage, this could be either an\ninformation leak, or a backend-to-frontend privilege escalation.\n\nThe second issue is more difficult to analyze. It can probably cause\nreference counts to leak, preventing memory from being freed on domain\ndestruction (denial-of-service), but information leakage or host\nprivilege escalation cannot be ruled out.\n\nVULNERABLE SYSTEMS\n==================\n\nAll versions of Xen are vulnerable.\n\nBoth ARM and x86 are vulnerable.\n\nOn x86, systems with either PV or HVM guests are vulnerable.\n\nMITIGATION\n==========\n\nNone.\n\nExternal References:\n\nhttp://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-218.html\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nName: the Xen project\nUpstream: Jann Horn (Google)"

This is a race window where the underlying frame can\nchange ownership.\n\nOne possible attack scenario is for the frame to change ownership and to be\ninserted into a PV guest's pagetables.  At that point, the emulated write will\nbe an unaudited modification to the PV pagetables whose value is under guest\ncontrol.\n\nIMPACT\n======\n\nA malicious pair of guests may be able to elevate their privilege to that of\nXen.\n\nVULNERABLE SYSTEMS\n==================\n\nAll versions of Xen are vulnerable.\n\nOnly x86 systems are affected.  ARM systems are not vulnerable.\n\nHVM guests using shadow mode paging can exploit this vulnerability.  HVM guests\nusing Hardware Assisted Paging (HAP) cannot exploit this vulnerability.\n\nTo discover whether your HVM guests are using HAP, or shadow page\ntables: request debug key `q' (from the Xen console, or with\n`xl debug-keys q').  This will print (to the console, and visible in\n`xl dmesg'), debug information for every domain, containing something\nlike this:\n\n(XEN) General information for domain 2:\n(XEN)     refcnt=1 dying=2 pause_count=2\n(XEN)     nr_pages=2 xenheap_pages=0 shared_pages=0 paged_pages=0 dirty_cpus={} max_pages=262400\n(XEN)     handle=ef58ef1a-784d-4e59-8079-42bdee87f219 vm_assist=00000000\n(XEN)     paging assistance: hap refcounts translate external\n^^^\nThe presence of `hap' here indicates that the host is not\nvulnerable to this domain.  For an HVM domain the presence of `shadow'\nindicates that the domain can exploit the vulnerability.\n\nXen 4.6 and later have the option to compile-out shadow paging support.  (The\ndefault is to compile with shadow paging support).  If Xen is built without\nshadow support, it is not vulnerable.\n\nExploiting this race condition requires coordination between an x86 HVM guest\nusing shadow paging, and a PV guest.\n\nRunning only HVM guests avoids the vulnerability, unless stub device\nmodels are in use (since stub device models are PV domains, each\ncontrolled by the corresponding guest).\n\nRunning only PV guests avoids the vulnerability.\n\nMitigation:\n\nWhere the HVM guest is explicitly configured to use shadow paging (eg\nvia the `hap=0' xl domain configuration file parameter), changing to\nHAP (eg by setting `hap=1') will avoid exposing the vulnerability to\nthose guests.  HAP is the default (in upstream Xen), where the\nhardware supports it; so this mitigation is only applicable if HAP has\nbeen disabled by configuration.\n\n(This mitigation is not applicable to PV guests.)\n\nExternal References:\n\nhttp://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-219.html\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nName: the Xen project\nUpstream: Andrew Cooper (Citrix)"

However,\nsurprisingly, the use of these features is not dependent (PKU) or may\nnot be dependent (MPX) on having the relevant XSTATE bits enabled.\n\nVMs which use MPX or PKU, and context switch the state manually rather\nthan via XSAVE, will have the state leak between vCPUs (possibly,\nbetween vCPUs in different guests).  This in turn corrupts state in\nthe destination vCPU, and hence may lead to weakened protections\n\nExperimentally, MPX appears not to make any interaction with BND*\nstate if BNDCFGS.EN is set but XCR0.BND{CSR,REGS} are clear.  However,\nthe SDM is not clear in this case; therefore MPX is included in this\nadvisory as a precaution.\n\nIMPACT\n======\n\nThere is an information leak, of control information mentioning\npointers into guest address space; this may weaken address space\nrandomisation and make other attacks easier.\n\nWhen an innocent guest acquires leaked state, it will run with\nincorrect protection state.  This could weaken the protection intended\nby the MPX or PKU features, making other attacks easier which would\notherwise be excluded; and the incorrect state could also cause a\ndenial of service by preventing legitimate accesses.\n\nVULNERABLE SYSTEMS\n==================\n\nXen 4.4 and earlier are not vulnerable, as they do not use or expose\nMPX or PKU to guests.  Xen 4.5 and later expose MPX to guests.  Xen\n4.7 and later expose PKU to guests.  Therefore, Xen 4.5 and later are\nvulnerable.\n\nOnly x86 hardware implementing the MPX or PKU features is vulnerable.\nAt the time of writing, these are Intel Skylake (and later) processors\nfor MPX, and Intel Skylake Server (and later) processors for PKU.\n\nARM hardware is not vulnerable.\n\nThe vulnerability is only exposed to HVM guests.  PV guests cannot\nexploit the vulnerability.\n\nVulnerable guest operating systems\n- ----------------------------------\n\nGuests which use XSAVE for context switching PKU and MPX state are not\nvulnerable to inbound corruption caused by another malicious domain.\n\nWith respect to PKU, the remaining outbound information leak is of no\nconceivable consequence.  And, experimentally, MPX does not appear to\nhave a real vulnerability, even though the CPU documentation is not\nclear.\n\nTherefore we think that these guests (those which use XSAVE) are not\nvulnerable.\n\nLinux uses XSAVE, so is therefore not vulnerable.\n\nMITIGATION\n==========\n\nPassing \"pku=0\" on the hypervisor command line will avoid the PKU\nvulnerability (by not advertising the feature to guests).\n\nThere is no corresponding option for the probably-theoretical MPX\nvulnerability.\n\nExternal References:\n\nhttp://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-220.html\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nName: the Xen project\nUpstream: Andrew Cooper (Citrix)"

This bug can be leveraged cause a page's reference\ncounts and type counts to fall to zero while retaining writeable\nmappings to the page.\n\n* Under some specific conditions, if a grant is mapped with both the\nGNTMAP_device_map and GNTMAP_host_map flags, the operation may not\ngrab sufficient type counts.  When the grant is then unmapped, the\ntype count will be erroneously reduced.  This bug can be leveraged\ncause a page's reference counts and type counts to fall to zero while\nretaining writeable mappings to the page.\n\n* When a grant reference is given to an MMIO region (as opposed to a\nnormal guest page), if the grant is mapped with only the\nGNTMAP_device_map flag set, a mapping is created at host_addr anyway.\nThis does *not* cause reference counts to change, but there will be no\nrecord of this mapping, so it will not be considered when reporting\nwhether the grant is still in use.\n\nIMPACT\n======\n\nFor the worst issue, a PV guest could gain a writeable mapping of its\nown pagetable, allowing it to escalate its privileges to that of the\nhost.\n\nVULNERABLE SYSTEMS\n==================\n\nAll versions of Xen are vulnerable.\n\nOnly x86 systems are vulnerable.\n\nAny system running untrusted PV guests is vulnerable.\n\nSystems with untrusted HVM guests are only vulnerable if those guests\nare served by a trusted PV backend which is vulnerable: Namely, one\nwhich calls grant_map() with both the GNTMAP_device_map and\nGNTMAP_host_map flags.  The security team is not aware of any backends\nwhich are vulnerable.\n\nMitigation:\n\nRunning only HVM guests will avoid this vulnerability.\n\nExternal References:\n\nhttp://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-224.html\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nName: the Xen project\nUpstream: Jan Beulich (SUSE)"

The ultimate effect of\nthis would be for maptrack entries for a single domain to be re-used.\n\nIMPACT\n======\n\nFor the first issue, for a short window of time, a malicious backend\ncould still read and write memory that the frontend thought was its\nown again.

This is a race window where the underlying frame can\nchange ownership.\n\nOne possible attack scenario is for the frame to change ownership and to be\ninserted into a PV guest's pagetables.  At that point, the emulated write will\nbe an unaudited modification to the PV pagetables whose value is under guest\ncontrol.\n\nIMPACT\n======\n\nA malicious pair of guests may be able to elevate their privilege to that of\nXen.\n\nVULNERABLE SYSTEMS\n==================\n\nAll versions of Xen are vulnerable.\n\nOnly x86 systems are affected.  ARM systems are not vulnerable.\n\nHVM guests using shadow mode paging can exploit this vulnerability.  HVM guests\nusing Hardware Assisted Paging (HAP) cannot exploit this vulnerability.\n\nTo discover whether your HVM guests are using HAP, or shadow page\ntables: request debug key `q' (from the Xen console, or with\n`xl debug-keys q').  This will print (to the console, and visible in\n`xl dmesg'), debug information for every domain, containing something\nlike this:\n\n(XEN) General information for domain 2:\n(XEN)     refcnt=1 dying=2 pause_count=2\n(XEN)     nr_pages=2 xenheap_pages=0 shared_pages=0 paged_pages=0 dirty_cpus={} max_pages=262400\n(XEN)     handle=ef58ef1a-784d-4e59-8079-42bdee87f219 vm_assist=00000000\n(XEN)     paging assistance: hap refcounts translate external\n^^^\nThe presence of `hap' here indicates that the host is not\nvulnerable to this domain.  For an HVM domain the presence of `shadow'\nindicates that the domain can exploit the vulnerability.\n\nXen 4.6 and later have the option to compile-out shadow paging support.  (The\ndefault is to compile with shadow paging support).  If Xen is built without\nshadow support, it is not vulnerable.\n\nExploiting this race condition requires coordination between an x86 HVM guest\nusing shadow paging, and a PV guest.\n\nRunning only HVM guests avoids the vulnerability, unless stub device\nmodels are in use (since stub device models are PV domains, each\ncontrolled by the corresponding guest).\n\nRunning only PV guests avoids the vulnerability.\n\nMitigation:\n\nWhere the HVM guest is explicitly configured to use shadow paging (eg\nvia the `hap=0' xl domain configuration file parameter), changing to\nHAP (eg by setting `hap=1') will avoid exposing the vulnerability to\nthose guests.  HAP is the default (in upstream Xen), where the\nhardware supports it; so this mitigation is only applicable if HAP has\nbeen disabled by configuration.\n\n(This mitigation is not applicable to PV guests.)\n\nExternal References:\n\nhttp://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-219.html\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nName: the Xen project\nUpstream: Andrew Cooper (Citrix)"

								"thetext": "ISSUE DESCRIPTION\n=================\n\nMemory Protection Extensions (MPX) and Protection Key (PKU) are features in\nnewer processors, whose state is intended to be per-thread and context\nswitched along with all other XSAVE state.\n\nXen's vCPU context switch code would save and restore the state only\nif the guest had set the relevant XSTATE enable bits.  However,\nsurprisingly, the use of these features is not dependent (PKU) or may\nnot be dependent (MPX) on having the relevant XSTATE bits enabled.\n\nVMs which use MPX or PKU, and context switch the state manually rather\nthan via XSAVE, will have the state leak between vCPUs (possibly,\nbetween vCPUs in different guests).  This in turn corrupts state in\nthe destination vCPU, and hence may lead to weakened protections\n\nExperimentally, MPX appears not to make any interaction with BND*\nstate if BNDCFGS.EN is set but XCR0.BND{CSR,REGS} are clear.  However,\nthe SDM is not clear in this case; therefore MPX is included in this\nadvisory as a precaution.\n\nIMPACT\n======\n\nThere is an information leak, of control information mentioning\npointers into guest address space; this may weaken address space\nrandomisation and make other attacks easier.\n\nWhen an innocent guest acquires leaked state, it will run with\nincorrect protection state.  This could weaken the protection intended\nby the MPX or PKU features, making other attacks easier which would\notherwise be excluded; and the incorrect state could also cause a\ndenial of service by preventing legitimate accesses.\n\nVULNERABLE SYSTEMS\n==================\n\nXen 4.4 and earlier are not vulnerable, as they do not use or expose\nMPX or PKU to guests.  Xen 4.5 and later expose MPX to guests.  Xen\n4.7 and later expose PKU to guests.  Therefore, Xen 4.5 and later are\nvulnerable.\n\nOnly x86 hardware implementing the MPX or PKU features is vulnerable.\nAt the time of writing, these are Intel Skylake (and later) processors\nfor MPX, and Intel Skylake Server (and later) processors for PKU.\n\nARM hardware is not vulnerable.\n\nThe vulnerability is only exposed to HVM guests.  PV guests cannot\nexploit the vulnerability.\n\nVulnerable guest operating systems\n- ----------------------------------\n\nGuests which use XSAVE for context switching PKU and MPX state are not\nvulnerable to inbound corruption caused by another malicious domain.\n\nWith respect to PKU, the remaining outbound information leak is of no\nconceivable consequence.  And, experimentally, MPX does not appear to\nhave a real vulnerability, even though the CPU documentation is not\nclear.\n\nTherefore we think that these guests (those which use XSAVE) are not\nvulnerable.\n\nLinux uses XSAVE, so is therefore not vulnerable.\n\nMITIGATION\n==========\n\nPassing \"pku=0\" on the hypervisor command line will avoid the PKU\nvulnerability (by not advertising the feature to guests).\n\nThere is no corresponding option for the probably-theoretical MPX\nvulnerability.\n\nExternal References:\n\nhttp://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-220.html\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nName: the Xen project\nUpstream: Andrew Cooper (Citrix)"
