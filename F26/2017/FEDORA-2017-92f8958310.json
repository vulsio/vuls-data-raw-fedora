The developer perhaps doesn't know that the option, specifically -falign-stack=4, will cause problems when entering SSE2 code."

This would fix this issue for glibc only.\n\nThat still leaves you to find and fix any dependent libraries that use SSE2 and require an aligned stack, but don't automatically align the stack themselves.\n \n> Are we expecting Valve and other vendors to recompile binaries or is this\n> going to be addressed on Fedora side?\n\nWhat Valve and the vendors do is up to them.\n\nIf Valve and the vendors compile their code with options that don't follow the ABI, then the applications will not run correctly.\n\nThey will have the same problem in all the other distributions that use SSE2 optimizations.\n\n> This is going to be a blocker for many Fedora home users. It should be\n> propably mentioned in the release notes at least. Something like \"Expect\n> Steam games to crash unde F26\".\n\nSure, how about:\n\n\"In Fedora 26 it has been found that some games distributed under STEAM may fail to start or crash. These 32-bit games crash because they have been incorrectly built (don't follow the i686 stack alignment requirements) and the authors of such games should rebuild as redistribute as needed.\"\n\nHow do we get this into the Fedora 26 release notes?"

The bulk of Fedora is compiled in such a way that SSE2 capabilities are not used, so the impact of the new GCC vectorization capabilities is greatly reduced compared to what other distributions see."
