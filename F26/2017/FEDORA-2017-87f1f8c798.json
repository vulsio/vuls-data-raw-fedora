								"thetext": "If named is configured to use Response Policy Zones (RPZ) an error processing some rule types can lead to a condition where BIND will endlessly loop while handling a query.\n\nA server is potentially vulnerable to degradation of service if\n    1. the server is configured to use RPZ,\n    2. the server uses NSDNAME or NSIP policy rules, and\n    3. an attacker can cause the server to process a specific query\n\nSuccessful exploitation of this condition will cause named to enter a state where it continues to loop while processing the query without ever reaching an end state. While in this state, named repeatedly queries the same sets of authoritative nameservers and this behavior will usually persist indefinitely beyond the normal client query processing timeout. By triggering this condition multiple times, an attacker could cause a deliberate and substantial degradation in service.\n\nVersions affected: 9.9.10, 9.10.5, 9.11.0->9.11.1, 9.9.10-S1, 9.10.5-S1\n\nWorkaround:\n\nOnly the NSDNAME and NSIP RPZ rule types can cause this condition to occur. You can work around this vulnerability if you are able to express your desired policy while avoiding NSDNAME or NSIP rules, otherwise it is advised that you upgrade to a version which corrects the defect.\n\nReferences:\n\nhttps://kb.isc.org/article/AA-01495/74/CVE-2017-3140\n\nUpstream patch:\n\nhttps://source.isc.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=bind9.git;a=commit;h=2648c49be78"

								"thetext": "An attacker able to send and receive messages to an authoritative DNS server may be able to circumvent TSIG authentication of AXFR requests via a carefully constructed request packet. A server that relies solely on TSIG keys for protection with no other ACL protection could be manipulated into:\n\n* providing an AXFR of a zone to an unauthorized recipient\n* accepting bogus Notify packets\n\nAn unauthorized AXFR (full zone transfer) permits an attacker to view the entire contents of a zone.  Protection of zone contents is often a commercial or business requirement.\n\nIf accepted, a Notify sets the zone refresh interval to 'now'. If there is not already a refresh cycle in progress then named will initiate one by asking for the SOA RR from its list of masters.  If there is already a refresh cycle in progress, then named will queue the new refresh request.  If there is already a queued refresh request, the new Notify will be discarded. Bogus notifications can't be used to force a zone transfer from a malicious server, but could trigger a high rate of zone refresh cycles.\n\n\nWorkarounds:\n\nThe effects of this vulnerability can be mitigated by using Access Control Lists (ACLs) that require both address range validation and use of TSIG authentication in parallel. For information on how to configure this type of compound authentication control, please see:\n\nhttps://kb.isc.org/article/AA-00723/0/Using-Access-Control-Lists-ACLs-with-both-addresses-and-keys.html.\n\n(Note that this technique will not be effective against bogus Notify packets if an attacker is able to reach the target DNS server whilst using a spoofed sending address).\n\n\nUpstream patch:\n\nhttps://source.isc.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=bind9.git;a=commitdiff;h=581c1526ab"
