When large pages are in use for this\ntable, such an operation may incur a memory allocation (to replace a\nlarge mapping with individual smaller ones).  If this allocation\nfails, the p2m_set_entry() function will return an error.\n\nUnfortunately, several places in the populate-on-demand code don't\ncheck the return value of p2m_set_entry() to see if it succeeded.\n\nIn some cases, the operation was meant to remove an entry from the p2m\ntable.  If this removal fails, a malicious guest may engineer that the\npage be returned to the Xen free list, making it available to be\nallocated to another domain, while it retains a writable mapping to\nthe page.\n\nIn other cases, the operation was meant to remove special\npopulate-on-demand entries; if this removal fails, the internal\naccounting becomes inconsistent and may eventually hit a BUG().\n\nThe allocation involved comes from a separate pool of memory created\nwhen the domain is created; under normal operating conditions it never\nfails, but a malicious guest may be able to engineer situations where\nthis pool is exhausted.\n\nIMPACT\n======\n\nAn unprivileged guest can retain a writable mapping of freed memory.\nDepending on how this page is used, it could result in either an\ninformation leak, or full privilege escalation.\n\nAlternatively, an unprivileged guest can cause Xen to hit a BUG(),\ncausing a clean crash - ie, host-wide denial-of-service (DoS).\n\nVULNERABLE SYSTEMS\n==================\n\nAll systems from Xen 3.4 are vulnerable.\n\nOnly x86 systems are vulnerable.

A domain can always map, at least r/o, pages of which it\nis the owner.  Certain fields in the control structure of a page are\nused for different purposes in the main PV memory management code and\nin code handling shadow paging.\n\nWhen a guest is running in shadow mode (which for PV guests is necessary\ne.g. for live migration), certain auxiliary pages used by Xen internally\nhad their owner set to the guest itself.  When the PV guest maps such a\npage, shadow code and PV memory management code will disagree on the\nmeaning of said multi-purpose fields, generally leading to a crash of\nthe hypervisor.\n\nIMPACT\n======\n\nA malicious or buggy PV guest may cause a hypervisor crash, resulting in\na Denial of Service (DoS) affecting the entire host, or cause hypervisor\nmemory corruption.  We cannot rule out a guest being able to escalate\nits privilege.\n\nVULNERABLE SYSTEMS\n==================\n\nAll versions of Xen are vulnerable.\n\nOnly x86 systems are affected.  ARM systems are not vulnerable.\n\nx86 HVM guests cannot exploit this vulnerability.\n\nOnly x86 PV guests can exploit this vulnerability, and only when being\nrun in shadow mode.  PV guests are typically run in shadow mode for live\nmigration, as well as for features like VM snapshot.\n\nNote that save / restore does *not* use shadow mode, and so does not\nexpose this vulnerability.  Some downstreams also include a \"non-live\nmigration\" feature, which also does not use shadow mode (and thus does\nnot expose this vulnerability).\n\nMITIGATION\n==========\n\nRunning only HVM guests avoids the vulnerability.\n\nAvoiding live migration of x86 PV guests also avoids the vulnerability.\n\nExternal References:\n\nhttp://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-248.html"
