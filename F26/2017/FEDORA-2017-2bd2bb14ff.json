						"thetext": "Created attachment 1283928\nFedora 25 WPA Enterprise configuration screen\n\nDescription of problem:\n\nWhen setting up a wireless network for WPA or WPA2 Enterprise, the only verification that is exposed for the authentication server is via the CA Server, as opposed to any sort of verification of the authentication server itself.  The impact here is that an attacker with an \"evil twin\" access point can capture authentication attempts, which can be cracked offline.\n\n\nVersion-Release number of selected component (if applicable):\n1:1.4.4-5.fc25\n\nHow reproducible:\nAlways\n\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Run nm-connection-editor\n2. Add or Edit WiFi connection\n3. Click Wi-Fi Security tab\n4. Select \"WPA & WPA2 Enterprise\"\n5. Select \"PEAP\" for Authentication\n6. Try to ensure that you'll not connect to an attacker's access point.\n\nActual results:\nWhen configured via the GUI, there is no way to ensure that your WiFi connection will not attempt to authenticate with an attacker's RADIUS server.  The best that can be done is to verify the *CA* that issued the certificate, rather than verifying the certificate itself.  An attacker could just purchase a certificate from the same CA as is used by the network being impersonated.\n\nExpected results:\nThe authentication settings in the NetworkManager GUI should expose some way to prevent authentication attempts with an attacker.  Possible techniques include:\n1. Expose in the GUI a field for the domain name associated with the WiFi connection. This puts WiFi authentication on the same level as non-pinned HTTPS web communication.  That is, you are trusting that the CA has done its due diligence to ensure that the provided certificate is indeed for the domain name listed.  Android 7.0 does this.\n2. Even if the network's authentication server certificate is issued by an OS-trusted CA, require certificate validation on the first attempt to connect to the WiFi network.  After that, only attempt to authenticate with the network if the certificate matches.  MacOS and iOS do this.\n\n\nAdditional info:\n\nIt's not clear at this point what Windows does to connect/remember 802.1x-authenticated networks, but in my brief testing Windows does not attempt to authenticate to an attacker's network.  Out of popular modern operating systems, I've only seen Linux/NetworkManager do this.\n\nI've only been testing PEAP.  But it's possible that other Enterprise authentication schemes like TLS and TTLS could also benefit from the improvements described above.\n\nhostapd-wpe <https://github.com/OpenSecurityResearch/hostapd-wpe> was used for simulating an attacker's access point."

Also, technically \"evil.serv.company.com\" indeed belongs to the \"serv.company.com\" domain."

Just like there should be a single full domain name to identify a website or email server, I think the same applies to an authentication server."
