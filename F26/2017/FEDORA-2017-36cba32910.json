Our original testing was on 64-bit architecture, where the number of messages to cause virtual address space exhaustion would exceed one billion, making such an attack infeasible.  Tests with 32-bit architectures are in progress.\n\n> 2) A similar but less efficient attack can be mounted against NFS, which is\n> a far more serious threat since it lives in the kernel.

Our kernel security team are looking into this to determine if a similar vulnerabilty may exist.\n\nIf you have further information about the exploitability of either of these vectors or anything not yet discussed in public, please contact secalert@redhat.com."

I am working on proof-of-concept code for both (DoS against rpcbind + kernel address space exhaustion)."

Per comments on the glibc mailing list (and having looked at several other users of libtirpc that don't seem to suffer such leaks), calls to xdr_* parsers should be matched with xdr_free, even in the error case.  There are some convenience layers for sunrpc in particular to help with this:  clnt_call/clnt_destroy and svc_getargs/svc_freeargs.  rpcbind in these spots is using the latter, but can bypass svc_freeargs in the error case.\n\nI think the patch to libtirpc is still a good idea as it hardens the library against such errors.  The one in comment 23 looks good to me.\n\nIn more complex cases, client code calling the free/destroy/freeargs methods appropriately is even more important:  I think a structure containing two xdr_strings could parse the first one correctly, then reject the second one, leaving allocated memory that only the caller can release.  For a UDP protocol, the chunks will be small, but they will be a persistent leak."

The one in comment 23 looks good to me.\n\nI think you got it a little backward.  The memory leak is in libtirpc and *must* be fixed, everything else in Vranken's patch is just mitigation and *should* be fixed.  If I understand correctly, your rpcbind patch fixes a separate issue where rpcbind uses the library incorrectly.\n\nThere are a couple of style issues in the patch:  \"rc = (TRUE)\" and \"rc = (FALSE)\" should be \"rc = TRUE\" and \"rc = FALSE\" respectively, and \"return rc\" should be \"return (rc)\" to conform to the BSD coding standards.\n\nAs for mitigation: you can protect the machine, but not the service.  A well executed attack will cause rpcbind to either stop responding or die.  If it is restarted, it will be useless since all the services that depend on it must also be restarted in order to re-register, because the state file is only created upon clean shutdown."

I suspect an interface that gets two strings as input, where only the second is truncated, would still leak with the libtirpc patch alone.\n\nThat's what my patch tries to address in rpcbind - the svc_getargs() calls are not consistently matched with svc_freeargs() in the error case.  With this patch I'm no longer able to reproduce the original memory leak.\n\nTo be sure, I think patching both components is a good idea.  I'll defer to package maintainers more intimate with the interfaces to determine what combination of mitigation / logic fix should be applied, and we'll test carefully with variants of the attack."
