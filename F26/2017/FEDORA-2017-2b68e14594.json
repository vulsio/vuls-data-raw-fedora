It will be reviewed according to https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA:SOP_blocker_bug_process . If you can, please specify the release criterion that the bug violates. See https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_Release_Criteria for details on the release criteria.\n\nIf the bug is not serious enough to block release but you believe it merits being fixed during a milestone freeze (see https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Milestone_freezes ), you can propose it as a 'freeze exception' instead. To do this, mark it as blocking the bug F26BetaFreezeException . See https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA:SOP_freeze_exception_bug_process for the freeze exception process."

And I tested with 3 different fedora 26 machines. It crashed even in f26 docker containers(x86_64, i686) which I use for integration testing of unrelated project. It does not look like a corner-case to me. Or only very low change that only I hit bug everywhere.\n\nBTW If you really cannot reproduce yourself and need more logs/info/valgrind output ... then I will be glad to provide them."

Which is the whole point: people HAVE tested the fix in good faith without seeing the crashes you're seeing. Not everybody has openldap-servers installed, and (thank goodness) not many packages are naughty enough to call rpm from scriptlets. \n\nRunning rpm queries manually during the upgrade would have the same effect so it's not all just about naughty packages either.\n\nIn any case, good thing is it did get caught before going further, updates-testing served its purpose."

However since this is a feature of the -21 build there is a window in the update process after the new glibc is already installed and before the libdb -21 build gets installed during which an external process might freeze when accessing rpmdb's environment due to not being able to work with new glibc internals.\n\nIn the former case, having the libdb -21 build already installed on the system before running the upgrade to F26 makes libdb able to use its own internal flock-style lock of the environment (that is part of the fix for bug 1394862) during the upgrade instead of relying on the rpm's transaction lock (though the hack is still there to be able to install libdb -21 f24/25 build in the first place) so it would definitely be more safer running the upgrade this way.\n\nIn either of those cases I have yet to see a hang/crash get reproduced (if you can, let me know!)."

That's what happens with rpm itself (obviously). However doing the same with dnf:\n\n# dnf --releasever=25 --installroot /srv/test --setopt=keepcache=true install bash\n[...]\n# db_stat -CA -h /srv/test/var/lib/rpm|wc -l\n162\n\nIn this case they're all READ locks which rpm will mope up on the next run but it'll complain loudly. I know I've seen fleeting glimpses of those complaints where they shouldn't have existed, just haven't had a chance to investigate. But the screwy thing here is that the environment should not even exist after dnf exits! So it seems dnf is (re)opening the rpmdb from inside the chroot which is ... not a good idea. This is with dnf 1.1.10 on F24, IIRC F25 has 2.0 and newer hawkey/whatever so there's plenty of room for different behavior. \n\nYou said you can reproduce it with yum-deprecated, but can you actually reproduce the hang if you *only* use yum-deprecated all the way? (ie after using \"rm -f /var/lib/rpm/__db*\" to clear any cruft from earlier runs)"

It's not the first time such glibc changes cause trouble for rpmdb, just been a while since the last one and BDB locks are still just as ill-suited for rpm as they ever were...\n\nTechnically this is a dupe of bug 1394862 but I'm leaving this open for now:\n1) people are more likely to find an rpm bug than a libdb one when installation hangs\n2) we might need to come up with some kind of workaround, we can't have every other upgrade blowing up in the middle\n\nAs for 2), we could have a trigger on glibc to always nuke the environment in that case, but I worry what it does to the already running rpm instance. Or we could have rpm use private bdb locking but that opens up other issues. Or something..."

What I mean by this can be described as follows:\n\nPackages and versions of packages tend to change over time. But quite often building (or re-building) an RPM SRC packages have a strict dependency for older versions of a package (most likely the one it initially was compiled against with).\n\nIn a flow of dependency resolving (one package resolves the requirements of another) this might cause (quite often) the issue that one or other *required* packages (for building things) wants an older version. dnf can keep up doing this by using --allowerasing so it can resolve conflicts on its own and downgrade the packages as needed. Usually the downgrades are required for some header files. After compiling the packages they usually run perfectly with never versions of any libraries. But if the downgrading also requires that an older version of the library must be installed back (as the example below) then there is a risk, that on building farms and building machines, that the issue with db5 crashes comes back (as it happened a few moments ago).\n\nSo one of the packages below (in the dependency tree) enforces a downgrade of libdb (I haven't verified this yet!!!).\n\nDependencies resolved.\n================================================================================\n Package                   Arch     Version             Repository         Size\n================================================================================\nInstalling:\n dbus-glib-devel           x86_64   0.108-2.fc26        fedora             73 k\n perl-ExtUtils-Depends     noarch   0.405-4.fc26        fedora             30 k\n perl-ExtUtils-MakeMaker   noarch   7.24-2.fc26         fedora            295 k\n perl-ExtUtils-PkgConfig   noarch   1.15-7.fc26         fedora             19 k\n perl-Glib                 x86_64   1.324-2.fc26        fedora            368 k\n perl-Glib-devel           x86_64   1.324-2.fc26        fedora             70 k\n perl-devel                x86_64   4:5.24.1-390.fc26   updates-testing   575 k\n perl-generators           noarch   1.10-2.fc26         fedora             16 k\nInstalling dependencies:\n gdbm-devel                x86_64   1.13-1.fc26         updates-testing    62 k\n libdb-devel               x86_64   5.3.28-17.fc26      fedora             42 k\n perl-ExtUtils-Command     noarch   7.24-2.fc26         fedora             17 k\n perl-ExtUtils-Install     noarch   2.04-367.fc26       fedora             44 k\n perl-ExtUtils-Manifest    noarch   1.70-366.fc26       fedora             35 k\n perl-ExtUtils-ParseXS     noarch   1:3.31-368.fc26     fedora             81 k\n perl-Fedora-VSP           noarch   0.001-5.fc26        fedora             23 k\n perl-Storable             x86_64   1:2.56-368.fc26     fedora             83 k\n perl-Test-Harness         noarch   3.39-1.fc26         updates-testing   276 k\n perl-version              x86_64   5:0.99.18-1.fc26    updates-testing    64 k\n systemtap-sdt-devel       x86_64   3.1-5.fc26          updates-testing    71 k\nDowngrading:\n libdb                     x86_64   5.3.28-17.fc26      fedora            748 k\n libdb-utils               x86_64   5.3.28-17.fc26      fedora            137 k\n\nTransaction Summary\n================================================================================\nInstall    19 Packages\nDowngrade   2 Packages"

The effect of referring to another mapping of the same object when locking, unlocking, or destroying the object is undefined. [TSH] [Option Start]  If the process-shared attribute is set to PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED, only the synchronization object itself can be used for performing synchronization; however, it need not be referenced at the address used to initalize it (that is, another mapping of the same object can be used). [Option End]  The effect of referring to a copy of the object when locking, unlocking, or destroying it is undefined.\n\nFor spin locks, the above requirements shall apply as if spin locks have a process-shared attribute that is set from the pshared argument to pthread_spin_init(). For semaphores, the above requirements shall apply as if semaphores have a process-shared attribute that is set to PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE if the pshared argument to sem_init() is zero and set to PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED if pshared is non-zero.\n~~~\n\nThe serialization of the POSIX thread object into the database is undefined behaviour as noted under \"The effect of referring to a copy of the object when locking, unlocking, or destroying it is undefined.\"\n\nYou may only use initialized objects.\n\nI'm moving this to libdb to get fixed."

It is conceivable that this issue becomes a blocker for F26 if it reproduces consistently during installs or upgrades.\n\nThis needs to be fixed in Berkeley DB, this is a error in the use of the POSIX threads primitives which constrains the implementation from moving forward with beneficial changes e.g. correctness and performance for condition variables (the reason the internal type representation changed).\n\n> How hard would it be to make this old unused bit value also understood as\n> unused value in new glibc?\n\nTLDR; we would never support detecting of the old unused bit value.

The cost is non-zero, the cost is on the hot path for all other applications that use the type (even with versioning apps pay the price until they are recompiled), and it would be only to support an undefined use.\n\n> > Storing the condvar in the database file means that effectively, the program\n> > is expecting different versions of glibc to use the same bit representations\n> > of internal data structures.

The use of PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED has to trigger some kind of versioned data interface e.g. a condvar with a version field which detects the version in use and switches to the appropriate algorithm. This would incur significant costs when using PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED objects, and the use case has never become so important to support that we have supported it. Either way the glibc upgrade for Process B required a reboot, so as Florian argues you need to reboot, in which case you get a consistent view of the condvar and everything works optimally. The text as written in POSIX argues the above should be supported, but glibc doesn't support it.\n\n(2) Mixed 32-bit and 64-bit implementations with PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED (similar to (1)).\n\nWhile this is similar to (1) and can be considered a case of \"another implementation of narrower type\" I want to call it out separately.\n\nThe other case is a mixed 32-bit and 64-bit process case where the processes share types in shared memory, and this doesn't work correctly for the obvious reasons that the types are different ABIs. Making it work could again be part of making PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED truly \"proces shared\" across an ABI boundary for 32-bit and 64-bit code (reserve a bit in the version field for an ABI flag). Again this use case has never been important enough from a user perspective that we would attempt to fix it (though we face a similar problem in nscd with shared maps of the database caches)."

I don't have the spare time to see this through in detail.  I can help regarding how to use pthreads properly and with general concurrency considerations.\n\nTo reiterate, the problem is that libdb uses the glibc-internal binary representation in databases, and either (1) libdb or (2) how dnf uses libdb cause new glibc code to try to work on binary representation of old glibc code.  \n\nI'm splitting this up in (1) and (2) because it is not yet clear to me who exactly is at fault here.  libdb's documentation on upgrading libdb (see docs/upgrading/upgrade_process.html in libdb's source) is rather vague and fails to include glibc (or whatever provides pthreads) in it's consideration but does mention the compiler; this is odd at least from our perspective because things like datastructure layout are part of the ABI guarantees but glibc-internal representations are not part of the ABI.  libdb could state that any pthreads-implementation update is to be considered to be a libdb major/minor update -- but it does not do that AFAIK, and it's unclear whether that would help.\n\nlibdb could require that only the same build of libdb including the same build of the pthreads implementation are active on the same database concurrently.  If it would shut down all mutexes when there are no references left and reinitialize them when a new reference comes in, this should be sufficient to not trigger the glibc update problem under that requirement.  In this case, it may be simply dnf's fault if dnf does not enforce that no process must hold a reference on dnf's databases while glibc is upgraded.\nSecond, I have looked a bit at the code for libdb mutex, mutex regions, and environments, but I haven't figured out yet whether libdb actually destroys all mutexes when the last reference to a database is removed.\nNonetheless, making this scenario work could be a solution.\n\nAnother solution could be to say that glibc upgrades are like libdb major/minor upgrades, and then follow (some of) the steps outlined in docs/upgrading/upgrade_process.html for every user of libdb.  This requires touching more packages, but may be easier to enforce than the first solution, which requires checking whether libdb clients cannot hold a reference across updates of glibc.\n\nA third solution would be to version databases and include glibc's version in there.  But that doesn't provide automatic capability, and would probably require quite a few changes to libdb.\n\nI guess it would be best to look at the first solution first, starting with trying to find out what libdb actually guarantees or intends to guarantee.  Any suggestions for where to get this information?"

First, libdb should show that it can't just do reference counting, for example, and re-initialize any condvars it uses whenever the a database transitions from not being used to used.

DBENV recovery on glibc version change via a %posttrans cleanup action\n\nThe first idea I have already mentioned in comment 22.\nThe second idea is something I have thrown into the discussion as a workaround  specifically for rpm. I have tried looking at this idea a bit more to see if it would actually work and found out, that there are additional issues connected with it.\nAFAIK there are 3 ways to go about forcing the environment to recover:\nFirst \"rpm --rebuilddb\", but this does not work as it needs a transaction lock that is held by the rpm process doing the install/update action.\nSecond is \"db_recover -h /var/lib/rpm\" which is the libdb way of doing the recovery. This does work in recovering the environment but results in the rpm process throwing DB_RUNRECOVERY errors.\nThird way is just removing the problematic region files by force via \"rm -f /var/lib/__db.00*\" but it seems rpm is recreating them with the old glibc structures in place when the db/dbenv is closed.\n\nGenerally libdb upstream is against modifying their code to rebuild the environment every time it is accessed as that (together with the implementation of an \"in-use\" counter) would be a non-negligible hit to performance."

If there is a change in libdb which required change in rpm then both packages should be updated at once. Or both maintainers should be in sync.

Alas you failed and so I cannot.\n\n>It's not even just scriptlets calling rpm, it's *anything* opening the rpmdb ... \n\nTrue but it feels like the scriplets use case is one of the more visible ones given I seem to hit some issues with them pretty often.\nIn any way I am out of ideas on how to make this work for scriplets. We cannot remove the environment during scriplets as that breaks rpm since it does not expect that a scriplet might do that. On the other hand even if we were able to make scriplets use the old libdb shared library (is that even possible after it is already installed?) that would just cause issues in the packages running those scriplets (since those would just fail on environment version mismatch).\nThis leaves us once again with trying to keep the environment signature the same between those two versions, which, however would cause us to not be able to remember the pthreads version libdb was build against as it is currently saved in the environment."

This way openldap-server's scriplets would use the old version of libdb as it is still installed. As a result of openldap-server's trigger being run against the older version its libdb environment would not be upgraded but that should not pose any issues as far as I can see since libdb would just rebuild the environment by itself on the next time it is opened.\n\nHowever, as the new shared library would essentially be available only after the the %posttrans has gone through, any %postun or other %posttrans scriptlets that need libdb installed to work would fail...\n\nWhat do you guys think?

Which makes our hands a little bit less tied.\nAt this point rpm would just need to make sure that the environment is touched (hence rebuilt) before the transaction lock is taken since the rpm lock check will never get hit when the environment does not need to be rebuilt.\n\nafaics dnf opens the environment before any rpm transactions take place so this should already be safe when only working through dnf."

This is due to -21 having modified libdb's internal environment structures which was need to fix the original issue of this bz. Since the older versions do not have the automatic rebuild mechanism libdb will fail when trying to access the new environment...\n\nAlso note that this will happen for everyone currently on -21 and not only those that hit the bug I described in comment 98."

At any rate, this explains why many people are not seeing problems but some are.\n\nA dnf plugin executing rpm is just about as bad idea as running rpm queries from scriptlets, but changing that would require significant changes to etckeeper I suppose.\n\nAnyway, since the remaining issue with -21 is now pretty well understood, my suggestion is that -22 is pulled out of circulation ASAP (and/or replaced with -23 that includes the patch from -21 again), reverting the patch will only cause even more trouble at this point.\n\nThe more productive approach might be banging all drums available to tell people to:\n1) run the libdb -21 update in a transaction of its own, with --noplugins\n2) if it crashes, keep calm and run rpm --rebuilddb\n3) inform people about the known causes of problems (etckeeper-dnf at this point), most people will not experience any problems"

IIRC dnf does not have a way how to inform users before upgrade about important/breaking changes.

The root problem of this bug was libdb not failing when only the modify timestamp of libpthread has been changed, e.g. when glibc is updated after having first installed libdb -21 build (as is the case in F24/25-> F26 updates).\nUnfortunately the issue is not fixed as easy as by forcing libdb to fail every time it encounters a libpthread timestamp change. Dnf accesses the rpmdb a few times during the update process after the glibc has updated (= timestamp changed) and if libdb were to fail in those situations the update process might not be completed successfully.\nThe best fix I could come up with is taking a look at libdb's lock on its environment and checking if the pid of the process holding the lock is the same as the pid of the current process as that ensures that the environment is accessed with the correct glibc library version loaded.\nAfaik there is no easy way to do this check (for flock-style locks) so I have written a small parser that looks at /proc/locks and extracts the pid from there.\n\ndb-5.3.28-rpm-lock-check.patch\nSince I have written a /proc/locks parser as part of the patch described above I have modified the check for rpm's transaction lock to use it as well (to at least avoid fd leaks the original patch had).\nAlso fixed a few issues with the original patch (properly unlock the environment when not able to get the rpm lock, return success when the rpm lock file does not exist)."

This ruins strace and blocks any strace update.\n\nFor me it looks as if the kernel function syscall_get_error started to return 0 instead of the error code.\n\nThe logs are in the latest strace build task that failed:\nhttps://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/taskinfo?taskID=62171493\n\nThe kernel used for build there was\nLinux buildvm-ppc64le-14.iad2.fedoraproject.org 5.10.15-200.fc33.ppc64le #1 SMP Wed Feb 10 17:31:04 UTC 2021 ppc64le ppc64le ppc64le GNU/Linux\n\nFor comparison, the same version of strace passes all tests on all other rawhide architectures, as well as on Debian ppc64le (kernel 5.10.13-1).\n\nThe latest successfull strace build to rawhide was about 2 months ago:\nhttps://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=1658216\n\nThe kernel used for build there was\nLinux buildvm-ppc64le-38.iad2.fedoraproject.org 5.9.11-200.fc33.ppc64le #1 SMP Tue Nov 24 18:02:53 UTC 2020 ppc64le ppc64le ppc64le GNU/Linux"

This ruins strace and blocks any strace update.\n\nFor me it looks as if the kernel function syscall_get_error started to return 0 instead of the error code.\n\nThe logs are in the latest strace build task that failed:\nhttps://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/taskinfo?taskID=62171493\n\nThe kernel used for build there was\nLinux buildvm-ppc64le-14.iad2.fedoraproject.org 5.10.15-200.fc33.ppc64le #1 SMP Wed Feb 10 17:31:04 UTC 2021 ppc64le ppc64le ppc64le GNU/Linux\n\nFor comparison, the same version of strace passes all tests on all other rawhide architectures, as well as on Debian ppc64le (kernel 5.10.13-1).\n\nThe latest successfull strace build to rawhide was about 2 months ago:\nhttps://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=1658216\n\nThe kernel used for build there was\nLinux buildvm-ppc64le-38.iad2.fedoraproject.org 5.9.11-200.fc33.ppc64le #1 SMP Tue Nov 24 18:02:53 UTC 2020 ppc64le ppc64le ppc64le GNU/Linux"

And I tested with 3 different fedora 26 machines. It crashed even in f26 docker containers(x86_64, i686) which I use for integration testing of unrelated project. It does not look like a corner-case to me. Or only very low change that only I hit bug everywhere.\n\nBTW If you really cannot reproduce yourself and need more logs/info/valgrind output ... then I will be glad to provide them."

Which is the whole point: people HAVE tested the fix in good faith without seeing the crashes you're seeing. Not everybody has openldap-servers installed, and (thank goodness) not many packages are naughty enough to call rpm from scriptlets. \n\nRunning rpm queries manually during the upgrade would have the same effect so it's not all just about naughty packages either.\n\nIn any case, good thing is it did get caught before going further, updates-testing served its purpose."

								"thetext": "To extend upon Panu's comment:\n\nThe difference between upgrading from F24/25 with libdb updated to -21 and upgrading without the -21 libdb update already installed is that in the latter case (newly installed) libdb relies only on rpm's transaction lock to see whether it should rebuild rpmdb's environment due to VERSION_MISMATCH (change of libdb regions' internal structures) fixing the original glibc issue of bug 1394862. However since this is a feature of the -21 build there is a window in the update process after the new glibc is already installed and before the libdb -21 build gets installed during which an external process might freeze when accessing rpmdb's environment due to not being able to work with new glibc internals.\n\nIn the former case, having the libdb -21 build already installed on the system before running the upgrade to F26 makes libdb able to use its own internal flock-style lock of the environment (that is part of the fix for bug 1394862) during the upgrade instead of relying on the rpm's transaction lock (though the hack is still there to be able to install libdb -21 f24/25 build in the first place) so it would definitely be more safer running the upgrade this way.\n\nIn either of those cases I have yet to see a hang/crash get reproduced (if you can, let me know!)."

These errors are a result of packages calling rpm commands during installation and have so far been found harmless.\n\nYou can also run into issues with dnf plugins that do the same. As these plugins are run after the rpm transaction has already gone through successfully they should also be harmless. However, in this case a rebuild of rpmdb's environment will be needed. Detailed information on how to achieve this can be found in the links below.\n\nFor more information please take a look at:\n\nhttps://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Common_F26_bugs#upgrade-libdb\nhttps://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Common_F26_bugs#libdb-rebuilddb\n",
