Put a search list with more than 6 elements in resolv.conf, eg.:\n'\nsearch boston.redhat.com lab.boston.redhat.com corp.redhat.com devel.redhat.com\nbuild.redhat.com test.redhat.com redhat.com\n'\n2. Try to resolv a host in the 7th domain\n\nActual results:\n# ping people\nping: unknown host people\n# host people\npeople.redhat.com has address 172.16.48.237\n  \nExpected results:\nHosts in the 7th domain should resolve fine \n\nAdditional info:"

It states that:\n\n       By default, the source is \"nis\", but this may be overridden by specify‐\n       ing any NSS service except  \"compat\"  itself  as  the  source  for  the\n       pseudo-databases passwd_compat, group_compat, and shadow_compat.\n\nI can agree that using compat with SSSD is unusual, and I can't say if it is \"officially supported\" or not, but it works :)\n\nPS. For anyone encountering this issue: Easy workaround is to make sure that ypbind is installed prior to upgrade. In F25, the ypbind rpm requires nss_nis.\n\n-trond"

We started using NIS in the early 90's, I believe (before my time). At some point (also before my time) we switched to compat with NIS. We're still using compat/NIS on the very few remaining RHEL5 hosts (ugh), but from RHEL6 onwards we switched to compat/SSSD, with LDAP as backend for SSSD. The reason for choosing SSSD was its excellent caching functionality, among other things. We never considered NIS+.\n\nThe rationale behind compat is that we have a lot of users (about 50k), managed centrally in LDAP. We obviously don't want all users to be known on all Linux hosts, and with a de-centralized organization it has become important to have a consistent, quick and easy way to manage known users on Linux hosts. Since it's been this way for decades, everybody knows that in order to allow a user on Linux host, all you need is to add \"+user\" or \"+@netgroup\" in passwd. This approach has served us very well.\n\nAll hosts are configured using a centrally managed config management system (CFEngine), so that all systems are convergent and users/admins can expect the same basic behaviour from all of them.\n\nPS. As we've already put a workaround in place for this particular bz, my interest in this bug is only to improve Fedora."

Also, the \"+user\" or \"+@netgroup\" syntax wouldn't be legal as it isn't passed through nss_compat.\n\n> Are you able to test this on just one box?\n\nDon't need to test it, I know that it works :) But as I said, we want the ability to say that only these netgroups or users should be allowed to log in on a particular machine, and nss_compat is by far the easiest and most scalable way to achieve that."

You indirectly rely on the fact that PAM already has 'account required pam_permit.so' for most PAM-aware services (like login).\n\nThis is not a well tested feature combination for glibc nor a normally supported configuration outside of testing legacy support for the compat features.\n\nWould PAM or access.conf group-based login work for you?"

						"thetext": "(In reply to Carlos O'Donell from comment #9)\n\n> Why do you want fine-masked access control?\n> \n> What do you gain from it?\n\nThese are not easy questions to answer, but I'll do my best. To really understand why this is so valuable you need know how we're organized. This is a university, which has a lot of students, faculty, staff and other personnel that have user accounts. All accounts are managed centrally, but the users are organized mostly hierarchically in faculties, institutes and other departments. Each department/institute etc. usually have their own IT staff, that have privileges on \"their\" hosts. The local IT staff can delegate privileges to their users, e.g. \"power users\" may have administrative privileges on some hosts.\n\nWe make heavy use of netgroups to organize this in the IT world. These are also managed centrally, but local IT staff can often add and remove users from \"their\" netgroups.\n\nWe need an easy and understandable way for IT staff and \"power users\" to control access to hosts. For example, the Physics department usually don't want users from other departments on their equipment, and they may want to limit certain hosts to only students on a particular course, or only members of a particular research group. Linux knowledge across IT staff and users vary greatly, so this needs to be easy, understandable and consistent across OS releases.\n\nSo, we're de-centralized but with some central control. We use config management (in our case CFEngine) to manage aspects of the hosts that we consider important for security or consistency reasons. Login and access control mechanisms fall into that category, but employing these mechanisms is delegated.\n\n> > > It would elimitate the need to do any kind of \"+user\" or \"+@netgroup\"\n> > > additions?\n> > \n> > Yes, all users would be known.

We use the \"+foo\" syntax to achieve two things, one of which I forgot to mention earlier:\n\n1. Simple access control\n2. Overriding fields in passwd, usually home directory or shell\n\n> Two suggestions:\n> \n> (1) Use /etc/security/access.conf for group-based access to logins.\n> \n> (2) Use PAM to do group-based logins.\n> \n> Use pam_listfile\n> (http://www.linux-pam.org/Linux-PAM-html/sag-pam_listfile.html, with\n> item=group or item=user) since it is designed and tested for this kind of\n> functionality.\n> \n> Otherwise you are using a legacy feature to do access control to logins. You\n> indirectly rely on the fact that PAM already has 'account required\n> pam_permit.so' for most PAM-aware services (like login).\n\nThe important parts of the PAM stack are managed centrally with config management, so we do have control over that part.\n\n> This is not a well tested feature combination for glibc nor a normally\n> supported configuration outside of testing legacy support for the compat\n> features.\n> \n> Would PAM or access.conf group-based login work for you?\n\nI can't say yes or no to that. To be honest, nss_compat has worked so well for us, and for so long, and across various (now deprecated) UNIX variants and Linux, that we haven't really questioned it. It just works. But perhaps it's time to take a step back and evaluate this practice.\n\nI do know that changing something this fundamental (for us) can't be done in a heartbeat. We'll need to do this when adding a new distro version, such as a new version of Fedora and later RHEL8. But first we need to evaluate our options. Thanks for your feedback, suggestions and insight :)"
