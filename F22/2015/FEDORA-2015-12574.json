This mechanism is implemented via DNS, specificly a SRV record _rubygems._tcp under the original requested domain.\n\n  > dig _rubygems._tcp.rubygems.org SRV\n\n  ;; ANSWER SECTION:\n  _rubygems._tcp.rubygems.org. 600 IN\tSRV\t0 1 80 api.rubygems.org.\n\nRubyGems did not validate the hostname returned in the SRV record before sending requests to it.\n\nThis left clients open to a DNS hijack attack, whereby an attacker could return a SRV of their choosing and get the client to use it. For example:  \n\n  > dig _rubygems._tcp.rubygems.org SRV\n\n  ;; ANSWER SECTION:\n  _rubygems._tcp.rubygems.org. 600 IN\tSRV\t0 1 80 gems.nottobetrusted.wtf\n\"\"\"\n\nFix for this issue verifies that the returned host is on the same domain as the requested domain. This fix included:\n\n    if /#{host}\\z/ =~ target\n\nwhich is incomplete, because suffix match is sufficient, e.g. if the domain requested was rubygems.org, attacker served record of attackersrubygems.org would pass this check (CVE-2015-4020). The complete fix for both now includes:\n\n    if /\\.#{Regexp.quote(host)}\\z/ =~ target\n\n\nRubygems code is also bundled into ruby. The vulnerable code (function api_endpoint in lib/rubygems/remote_fetcher.rb) is present in ruby-2.0 and above.\n\nThis code is invoked like this:\n\nlib/rubygems/resolver/best_set.rb BestSet#pick_sets() cals\nlib/rubygems/source.rb Source#dependency_resolver_set() calls \nlib/rubygems/source.rb Source#api_uri() calls \nlib/rubygems/remote_fetcher.rb RemoteFetcher#api_endpoint()\n\nHowever, code that invokes vulnerable function was not added to ruby before 2.1.0, hence versions of ruby below 2.1 are not affected by this vulnerability, as the vulnerable code is included but never called."
