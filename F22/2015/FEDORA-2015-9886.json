When this analyzer is set then dmesg is called and dumped to the output dump directory. The dump file is given the permissions of the calling user, which allows any user to read dmesg.\n\nThe problem is that no appropriate checks or privilege dropping is done before calling dmesg.\n\nHow reproducible:\nAs long as bug is not duplicate (change type), always when the script is ran from any user.\n\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Set dmesg_restrict\n2. Run attached Python script\n3. Navigate to dump directory\n4.

If you would still like \nto see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version \nof Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora \nversion prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.\n\nAlthough we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's \nlifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events.

Perhaps the wrapper can open the file, using the calling user's UID/GID, and pass it on standard input.\n\nI also looked at the way in which yum creates the /var/tmp/yum-abrt-* directory, and it appears to be okay."

We have almost ready patches fixing the exploit but the fix is rather a work around, because it requires moving the abrt problem directories from the system directory (/var/tmp/abrt) to user home directories which makes the reporting process less comfortable and has a pair of side effects (e.g. breaks the local duplicate detection). So, the first step described in the bug description should be done in a week. The proper fix (the second step) needs more time and can done in a regular update."
