This makes NTLM special and a subject for special treatment in the\ncode. With NTLM, once the connection is authenticated, no further\nauthentication is necessary until the connection gets closed.\n\nlibcurl's connection re-use logic will select an existing connection for\nre-use when asked to do a request, and when asked to use NTLM libcurl have to\npick a connection with matching credentials only.\n\nIf a connection was first setup and used for an NTLM HTTP request with a\nspecific set of credentials, that same connection could later wrongly get\nre-used in a subsequent HTTP request that was made to the same host - but\nwithout having any credentials set! Since an NTLM connection was already\nauthenticated due to how NTLM works, the subsequent request could then get\nsent over the wrong connection appearing as the initial user.\n\nWe are not aware of any exploits of this flaw.\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Daniel Stenberg (curl upstream) for reporting this issue.
