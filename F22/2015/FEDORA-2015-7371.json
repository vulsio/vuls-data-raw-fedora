The hardware needs to change the audio codec modes and to do this it uses cached values from a cold boot.  If it's still broke in 4.1 after that, then some changes in ASOC have likely caused problems that need to be fixed yet."

I think the patches should be good for 4.0 headset.\n\n@darrell,\nWhat happened is this commit landed in 4.1: https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/b1ef2972586577e0ca9675254ee141f65a8824e5\n\nIf after multiple cold boots it's still not working, then there is some work to be done in ASOC to solve this.  That causes the sound card to be operating in I2S mode.\n\nIf you can handle performing a bisect, then you can narrow down what patch caused the sound to break.  You should start out by applying b1ef2972586577e0ca9675254ee141f65a8824e5 to 4.0 final and make sure it works there.  If it works, then bisect between 4.0 final and 4.1-rc1.  If you are building a version that doesn't contain b1ef2972586577e0ca9675254ee141f65a8824e5, manually apply that.  This should help to identify where the ASOC changes that caused the problem are at.  It's very important that you make sure b1ef2972586577e0ca9675254ee141f65a8824e5 is applied for all the kernels you test."

The good thing is that the kernel is fine. All we need to do is fixing libinput. Here is an WIP of the libinput work:\nhttp://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/taskinfo?taskID=9499333\n\nIt will only work for the pixel, but it makes it so much better that I need to share it. Having this upstream and in Fedora will take a little bit more time (hopefully by the end of next week if everything works out)."

						"thetext": "I tried the qemu command and see slowness.  Doing a side by side comparison of the journal after a boot for SMP and non-SMP shows that the boot is virtually identical in timing until userspace starts, so I guess that's good.\n\nOnce userspace starts, the SMP guest seems to have a varied order of things and the timings are indeed slower.  By the time you can get to a shell and look at the top output, you can see why.  The load avg is in the high 40s.  There are over 200 kworker threads sitting there waiting to run.  Over time the load average drops and the system seems just as usable.  The kworker threads are high in number on the non-SMP setup as well, but the load avg is down to 2.x by the time you can get to a shell.\n\nIf you boot a 4 CPU guest but use maxcpus=2 on the command line, the load average is still high but the timings are faster.  So whatever it is seems to scale (poorly) with the number of CPUs available.  I tried booting this via virt-manager instead of raw qemu and got the same results, so it doesn't seem dependent on the virtualized hardware or in-kernel drivers for this.\n\nMy best guess at this point is that systemd or something it starts is keying off of the number of available CPUs and starting a massive amount of work in the SMP cases.  I have an installed KVM guest running rawhide userspace that boots just fine here, so I'm guessing it is something in the live environment.  A macbook running F22 kernel and userspace is similarly fine.  I'd really like to test with either a 3.19.3 kernel and the latest 4.0-rc7 kernel to see if the kernel version really matters, but I'm not sure how to spin an otherwise identical live image with those included.\n\nWhen you say this is reproducible on the baremetal machine, did you mean if you boot the live image on the machine or after install?"
