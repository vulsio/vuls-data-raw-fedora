ARM systems are not vulnerable.\n\nThe vulnerability is only exposed to service domains with privilege over\nanother guest. In a usual configuration that means only device model\nemulators (qemu-dm) when these are running in a separate domain.\n\nIn the case of HVM guests whose device model is running in an\nunrestricted dom0 process, qemu-dm already has the ability to cause\nproblems for the whole system. So in that case the vulnerability is\nnot applicable.\n\nThis vulnerability is applicable for an HVM guest with a stub qemu-dm.\nThat is, where the device model runs in a separate domain (in the case\nof xl, as requested by \"device_model_stubdomain_override=1\" in the xl\ndomain configuration file). In this case a guest which has already\nexploited another vulnerability, to gain control of the device model,\nwould be able to exercise the information leak.\n\nHowever, the security of a system with qemu-dm running in a stub domain\nis still better than with a qemu-dm running as an unrestricted dom0\nprocess. Therefore users with these configurations should not switch\nto an unrestricted dom0 qemu-dm.\n\nFinally, in a radically disaggregated system, where the service domain\nsoftware (probably, the device model domain image in the HVM case) is\nnot always supplied by the host administrator, a malicious service\ndomain administrator can exercise this vulnerability.\n\nMITIGATION\n==========\n\nThere is no mitigation available.\n\nIn a radically disaggregated system, restricting HVM service domains\nto software images approved by the host administrator will avoid the\nvulnerability (so long as there isn't also a vulnerability in the\nservice domain).\n\nNOTE REGARDING LACK OF EMBARGO\n==============================\n\nThe fix for this bug was publicly posted on xen-devel, before it was\nappreciated that there was a security problem.\n\nCREDITS\n=======\n\nThis issue was recognized as security issue by Jan Beulich of SUSE.\n\nRESOLUTION\n==========\n\nApplying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.\n\nxsa132-unstable.patch xen-unstable, Xen 4.5.x, Xen 4.4.x, Xen 4.3.x\nxsa132-4.2.patch Xen 4.2.x\n\n$ sha256sum xsa132*.patch\n3a28eb33c02360ec22c51824e469b1cf6be87941256d0b3aa34a5bd1d7735328 xsa132-4.2.patch\n329d4edf1e1133795ece41f2fc8887c5f4cc06b42ced63c810c610b17bcee46d xsa132.patch"
