						"thetext": "ISSUE DESCRIPTION\n=================\n\nGuests are currently permitted to modify all of the (writable) bits in\nthe PCI command register of devices passed through to them. This in\nparticular allows them to disable memory and I/O decoding on the\ndevice unless the device is an SR-IOV virtual function, in which case\nsubsequent accesses to the respective MMIO or I/O port ranges would\n- - on PCI Express devices - lead to Unsupported Request responses. The\ntreatmeant of such errors is platform specific.\n\nIMPACT\n======\n\nIn the event that the platform surfaces aforementioned UR responses as\nNon-Maskable Interrupts, and either the OS is configured to treat NMIs\nas fatal or (e.g. via ACPI's APEI) the platform tells the OS to treat\nthese errors as fatal, the host would crash, leading to a Denial of\nService.\n\nVULNERABLE SYSTEMS\n==================\n\nXen versions 3.3 and onwards are vulnerable due to supporting PCI\npass-through. Upstream Linux versions 3.1 and onwards are vulnerable\ndue to supporting PCI backend functionality. Other Linux versions as\nwell as other OS versions may be vulnerable too.\n\nAny domain which is given access to a non-SR-IOV virtual function PCI\nExpress device can take advantage of this vulnerability.\n\nMITIGATION\n==========\n\nThis issue can be avoided by not assigning PCI Express devices other\nthan SR-IOV virtual functions to untrusted guests.\n\nRESOLUTION\n==========\n\nApplying the attached patch resolves this issue for upstream Linux.\n\nxsa120.patch Linux 3.19\n\n$ sha256sum xsa120*.patch\n5167215293d4a8a05f090fca5b20eb5878213a0158a0e7a12c245553db81a855 xsa120.patch"

To ignore these errors, you can set the '$QA_RPATHS'\n*          environment variable which is a bitmask allowing the values\n*          below. The current value of QA_RPATHS is 0x0000.\n*\n*    0x0001 ... standard RPATHs (e.g. /usr/lib); such RPATHs are a minor\n*               issue but are introducing redundant searchpaths without\n*               providing a benefit. They can also cause errors in multilib\n*               environments.\n*    0x0002 ... invalid RPATHs; these are RPATHs which are neither absolute\n*               nor relative filenames and can therefore be a SECURITY risk\n*    0x0004 ... insecure RPATHs; these are relative RPATHs which are a\n*               SECURITY risk\n*    0x0008 ... the special '$ORIGIN' RPATHs are appearing after other\n*               RPATHs; this is just a minor issue but usually unwanted\n*    0x0010 ... the RPATH is empty; there is no reason for such RPATHs\n*               and they cause unneeded work while loading libraries\n*    0x0020 ... an RPATH references '..' of an absolute path; this will break\n*               the functionality when the path before '..' is a symlink\n*          \n*\n* Examples:\n* - to ignore standard and empty RPATHs, execute 'rpmbuild' like\n*   $ QA_RPATHS=$[ 0x0001|0x0010 ] rpmbuild my-package.src.rpm\n* - to check existing files, set $RPM_BUILD_ROOT and execute check-rpaths like\n*   $ RPM_BUILD_ROOT=<top-dir> /usr/lib/rpm/check-rpaths\n*  \n*******************************************************************************\nERROR   0004: file '/usr/bin/cpupower' contains an insecure rpath './' in [./]\nerror: Bad exit status from /var/tmp/rpm-tmp.A6u26r (%install)\n    Bad exit status from /var/tmp/rpm-tmp.A6u26r (%install)\n\nVersion-Release number of selected component (if applicable):\nkernel-4.0.0-0.rc2.git0.1\n\nHow reproducible:\nEvery time\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.

								"thetext": "ISSUE DESCRIPTION\n=================\n\nGuests are currently permitted to modify all of the (writable) bits in\nthe PCI command register of devices passed through to them. This in\nparticular allows them to disable memory and I/O decoding on the\ndevice unless the device is an SR-IOV virtual function, in which case\nsubsequent accesses to the respective MMIO or I/O port ranges would\n- - on PCI Express devices - lead to Unsupported Request responses. The\ntreatmeant of such errors is platform specific.\n\nIMPACT\n======\n\nIn the event that the platform surfaces aforementioned UR responses as\nNon-Maskable Interrupts, and either the OS is configured to treat NMIs\nas fatal or (e.g. via ACPI's APEI) the platform tells the OS to treat\nthese errors as fatal, the host would crash, leading to a Denial of\nService.\n\nVULNERABLE SYSTEMS\n==================\n\nXen versions 3.3 and onwards are vulnerable due to supporting PCI\npass-through. Upstream Linux versions 3.1 and onwards are vulnerable\ndue to supporting PCI backend functionality. Other Linux versions as\nwell as other OS versions may be vulnerable too.\n\nAny domain which is given access to a non-SR-IOV virtual function PCI\nExpress device can take advantage of this vulnerability.\n\nMITIGATION\n==========\n\nThis issue can be avoided by not assigning PCI Express devices other\nthan SR-IOV virtual functions to untrusted guests.\n\nRESOLUTION\n==========\n\nApplying the attached patch resolves this issue for upstream Linux.\n\nxsa120.patch Linux 3.19\n\n$ sha256sum xsa120*.patch\n5167215293d4a8a05f090fca5b20eb5878213a0158a0e7a12c245553db81a855 xsa120.patch"
