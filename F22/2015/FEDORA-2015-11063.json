Your mentioned bugfixes seems to be reasonable to have also in Fedora 21.\n\nIn openssh-6.8 there was quite much of refactoring and changes in default that can be potentially harmful:\n\n * sshd(8): UseDNS now defaults to 'no'. Configurations that match\n   against the client host name (via sshd_config or authorized_keys)\n   may need to re-enable it or convert to matching against addresses.\n\nAnd new features changing behaviour:\n\n * Add FingerprintHash option to ssh(1) and sshd(8), and equivalent\n   command-line flags to the other tools to control algorithm used\n   for key fingerprints. The default changes from MD5 to SHA256 and\n   format from hex to base64.\n\n   Fingerprints now have the hash algorithm prepended. An example of\n   the new format: SHA256:mVPwvezndPv/ARoIadVY98vAC0g+P/5633yTC4d/wXE\n   Please note that visual host keys will also be different.\n\n\nAnd in openssh-6.7 few more:\n\n * sshd(8): The default set of ciphers and MACs has been altered to\n   remove unsafe algorithms. In particular, CBC ciphers and arcfour*\n   are disabled by default.\n\n   The full set of algorithms remains available if configured\n   explicitly via the Ciphers and MACs sshd_config options.\n\n * OpenSSH 6.5 and 6.6 have a bug that causes ~0.2% of connections\n   using the curve25519-sha256@libssh.org KEX exchange method to fail\n   when connecting with something that implements the specification\n   correctly. OpenSSH 6.7 disables this KEX method when speaking to\n   one of the affected versions.\n\nFor now, as it was announced, in F21 will land only security update and I will consider rebasing to 6.9 also there with maintaining compatible setup, if possible."
