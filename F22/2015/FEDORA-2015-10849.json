						"thetext": "This issue was mitigated in MySQL versions 5.5.49 and 5.6.30.  Quoting from the upstream release notes:\n\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/5.5/en/news-5-5-49.html\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/5.6/en/news-5-6-30.html\n\n  MySQL client programs now support an --ssl-mode option that enables you\n  to specify the security state of the connection to the server. If the\n  option is not specified, the default value is DISABLED (establish an\n  unencrypted connection). --ssl-mode=REQUIRED can be specified to require\n  a secure connection, or fail if a secure connection cannot be obtained.\n\n  These clients support --ssl-mode: mysql, mysqladmin, mysqlcheck,\n  mysqldump, mysqlimport, mysqlshow, mysqlpump, mysqlslap, mysqltest,\n  mysql_upgrade.\n\n  For more information, see Command Options for Secure Connections.\n\n  Note\n\n  In MySQL 5.7 and higher, the C client library provides native support for\n  requiring encrypted connections: call the mysql_options() C API function,\n  passing the MYSQL_OPT_SSL_MODE option with a value of SSL_MODE_REQUIRED.\n  In MySQL 5.6, the client library provides no such support because doing\n  so would break binary compatibility with previous library versions within\n  the series. Clients that require encrypted connections must implement the\n  logic themselves.\n\n  To require encrypted connections in MySQL 5.6, the standard MySQL client\n  programs use this technique: If --ssl-mode=REQUIRED was specified, the\n  client program turns on SSL, connects to the server, and checks whether\n  the resulting connection is encrypted. If not, the client exits with an\n  error. Third-party applications that must be able to require encrypted\n  connections can use the same technique. For details, see mysql_ssl_set().\n\nUpstream commit:\n\nhttps://github.com/mysql/mysql-server/commit/b3e9211e48a3fb586e88b0270a175d2348935424\n\nThis fix is limited in two ways:\n\n- It only applies to the client tools shipped with MySQL and does not address the problem for other programs using the libmysqlclient library.\n\n- To take advantage of the fix, relevant tools need to be invoked with the new --ssl-mode=REQUIRED option specified, either on command line or in my.cnf.  Note that a setting in my.cnf would force the use of SSL for all connections, regardless of whether --ssl command line option is used, so may not be usable where both SSL and non-SSL connections need to be made."

								"thetext": "This issue was mitigated in MySQL versions 5.5.49 and 5.6.30.  Quoting from the upstream release notes:\n\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/5.5/en/news-5-5-49.html\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/5.6/en/news-5-6-30.html\n\n  MySQL client programs now support an --ssl-mode option that enables you\n  to specify the security state of the connection to the server. If the\n  option is not specified, the default value is DISABLED (establish an\n  unencrypted connection). --ssl-mode=REQUIRED can be specified to require\n  a secure connection, or fail if a secure connection cannot be obtained.\n\n  These clients support --ssl-mode: mysql, mysqladmin, mysqlcheck,\n  mysqldump, mysqlimport, mysqlshow, mysqlpump, mysqlslap, mysqltest,\n  mysql_upgrade.\n\n  For more information, see Command Options for Secure Connections.\n\n  Note\n\n  In MySQL 5.7 and higher, the C client library provides native support for\n  requiring encrypted connections: call the mysql_options() C API function,\n  passing the MYSQL_OPT_SSL_MODE option with a value of SSL_MODE_REQUIRED.\n  In MySQL 5.6, the client library provides no such support because doing\n  so would break binary compatibility with previous library versions within\n  the series. Clients that require encrypted connections must implement the\n  logic themselves.\n\n  To require encrypted connections in MySQL 5.6, the standard MySQL client\n  programs use this technique: If --ssl-mode=REQUIRED was specified, the\n  client program turns on SSL, connects to the server, and checks whether\n  the resulting connection is encrypted. If not, the client exits with an\n  error. Third-party applications that must be able to require encrypted\n  connections can use the same technique. For details, see mysql_ssl_set().\n\nUpstream commit:\n\nhttps://github.com/mysql/mysql-server/commit/b3e9211e48a3fb586e88b0270a175d2348935424\n\nThis fix is limited in two ways:\n\n- It only applies to the client tools shipped with MySQL and does not address the problem for other programs using the libmysqlclient library.\n\n- To take advantage of the fix, relevant tools need to be invoked with the new --ssl-mode=REQUIRED option specified, either on command line or in my.cnf.  Note that a setting in my.cnf would force the use of SSL for all connections, regardless of whether --ssl command line option is used, so may not be usable where both SSL and non-SSL connections need to be made."
