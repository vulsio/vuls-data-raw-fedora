The interface would be given with random name like 'vethXXXXXX' and random MAC address like 'fe:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx'. If one set lxc.start.auto option to 1, the container would be initialized during system startup. However, due to wrong startup order defined in unit definition files, this happens prior to IP address configuration, and DHCP client would send to the DCHP server the fake MAC address mentioned above instead of NIC's MAC address. This may lead DHCP server to lease a wrong IP address based on fake MAC.\n\nReproducible: Always\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Assume your PC is connected to the network with DHCP server and PC NIC's MAC address is AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF.\n2. Tell DHCP server to lease certain IP address (192.168.1.100) to the MAC mentioned above (AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF).\n3. Install LXC, then set up an container with 'veth' network interface and add 'lxc.start.auto=1' option to enable autostart.\n4. Reboot\nActual Results:  \nThe PC would be given an arbitrary IP address, not that one you set up in DHCP server's configuration (192.168.1.100).\n\nExpected Results:  \nThe PC would be given IP address 192.168.1.100 - this is what you set up in DHCP server's configuration.\n\nThe bug can be fixed just by altering the order of LXC services startup. They must start just after network-online.target has been reached, not the network.target."
