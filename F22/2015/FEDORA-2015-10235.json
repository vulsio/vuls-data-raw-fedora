This package currently has a \"high\" impact rated security issue.  This is an issue that allows an attacker to circumvent SSL by redirecting a client to another host for a MITM attack while the user believes the connection is trusted and secure.  Kinda breaks the whole idea of opensaml.  If WildFly depends on this security, then WildFly is broken as well when using this package.\n\nYou stated you are to busy to maintain this, then please help find a new maintainer or orphan it so others can take over.  If we can not find anyone to maintain and patch critical and important security issues, then maybe we shouldn't be providing the package and letting our users be exposed.\n\nI do not currently use this package or wildfly, I don't have a setup to currently test this or build the patch (patch code for 2.6.2 linked to in my earlier comment).  I don't want to see this package abandoned but I've got a lot of other packages I need to help find patches for as well.  I can't take over maintenance for this, but I also can't leave it hanging around unpatched for nearly a year with no prospects for other issues being fixed."

This package currently has a \"high\" impact rated security issue.  This is an issue that allows an attacker to circumvent SSL by redirecting a client to another host for a MITM attack while the user believes the connection is trusted and secure.  Kinda breaks the whole idea of opensaml.  If WildFly depends on this security, then WildFly is broken as well when using this package.\n\nYou stated you are to busy to maintain this, then please help find a new maintainer or orphan it so others can take over.  If we can not find anyone to maintain and patch critical and important security issues, then maybe we shouldn't be providing the package and letting our users be exposed.\n\nI do not currently use this package or wildfly, I don't have a setup to currently test this or build the patch (patch code for 2.6.2 linked to in my earlier comment).  I don't want to see this package abandoned but I've got a lot of other packages I need to help find patches for as well.  I can't take over maintenance for this, but I also can't leave it hanging around unpatched for nearly a year with no prospects for other issues being fixed."

It is Fedora's policy to close all\nbug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time\nthis bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora  'version'\nof '20'.\n\nPackage Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you\nplan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version' \nto a later Fedora version.\n\nThank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not \nable to fix it before Fedora 20 is end of life. If you would still like \nto see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version \nof Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora \nversion prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.\n\nAlthough we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's \nlifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a \nmore recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes \nbugs or makes them obsolete."
