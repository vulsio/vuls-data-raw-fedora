						"thetext": "Description of problem:\nAfter upgrading to Fedora 21 my lirc IR blaster setup (for MythTV) no longer works.  Everything worked fine in F19 and earlier.  I've boiled the problem down to basic lirc/module commands.  I'm using a mceusb USB transceiver device.\n\nTrying to issue basic an irsend command results in:\nirsend: timeout\n\nmessages.  If I do enough irsends in a short time span, irsend eventually hangs and I've even gotten the kernel to oops (bug #1200304).\n\nThe funny thing is, the first few irsend commands I issue seem to be blasted to my set-top-box!  So that means everything is \"sort of\" working in the chain, down to the bare hardware, but something is keeping irsend from getting back a valid response in time.  My hunch is it's possibly the kernel module to blame (if so we can change the bug component).\n\nI'd love to debug but I can't figure out any way to get lircd to output debug or get the modules into debug mode (modprobe mceusb debug=1 just gives a \"mceusb: unknown parameter 'debug' ignored\" message.  I've checked out the irsend source and it's clear it's timing out waiting for a valid response from lircd.\n\n\nVersion-Release number of selected component (if applicable):\nkernel-PAE-3.18.8-201.fc21.i686\nlirc-0.9.1a-4.fc21.i686\n\n\nHow reproducible:\nAlways\n\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Setup a valid blaster lircd.conf (like my old one that worked in F19)\n2. lircd -n -H default  (or just use systemctl start lircd.service)\n3. irsend SEND_ONCE dct700 5\n\n\nActual results:\n<pause>\nirsend: timeout\nExit 1\n\nand blasted IR code sometimes actually is sent\n\n\nExpected results:\ninstantaneous return with no error message and all blasted IR codes are sent\n\n\nAdditional info:\n#lsusb\nBus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub\nBus 005 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub\nBus 004 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub\nBus 003 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub\nBus 002 Device 003: ID 0471:0815 Philips (or NXP) eHome Infrared Receiver\nBus 002 Device 002: ID 046d:c313 Logitech, Inc.

Perhaps one of these commits is the culprit?\n\nI can see two ways to proceed into this. I can try to support you either way, but since you are the only one which can reproduce the error...\n\nOne way would be to patch the current irsend code. Here are some obvious areas which could be improved (client logging, handling of EAGAIN/timeout). Fixing these should basically be done on upstream master: [2]. I don't really think the proposed patches would fix this, but it might (should?) give more information than we have today. I don't think you need to install lirc to run these tests, it could be done on an un-installed but built tree.\n\nThe other way would be to try to bisect the mceusb driver. Rebuilding the driver isn't hard, there is example code in drivers/ (upstream tree). Question is just how far back we can go before the driver becomes incompatible with current overall kernel (no idea).\n\n\n[1] https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commits/master/drivers/media/rc/mceusb.c\n[2] http://sourceforge.net/p/lirc/git/ci/master/tree/"

Is there somewhere that keeps every kernel rpm ever released to stable (or testing)?\n\nI've never had luck with bisecting \"fedora-ized\" kernel with git using Fedora, especially on 32-bit systems where I hit bugs using instructions I found from Fedora people.  I'm clueless at the process and would need some good links with instructions.  It's so much easier to find interim rpm versions if I can.\n\nHelp!"

I've already started some of what you suggest, let me tackle the points:\n\n> The kernel module history is at [1].

I think I'll concentrate on mceusb module before hitting the lirc git unless you think the above paragraph is a wiser place to start still.\n\n> The other way would be to try to bisect the mceusb driver. Rebuilding the\n> driver isn't hard, there is example code in drivers/ (upstream tree).\n> Question is just how far back we can go before the driver becomes\n> incompatible with current overall kernel (no idea).\n\nYa, I tried compiling the \"fedora way\" an older version of mceusb to that git commit I list above and it wouldn't build due to missing fn rc_set_allowed_protocols which seems to have been removed from an include file, as it's no where to be grepped in the vanilla source now.  That's only Apr 2014 which isn't very far back at all.\n\nI guess I could keep stepping back a commit at a time until I find one that compiles.  But no other newer commits seem to have anything interesting that might be causing this bug (but I'm no expert).\n\nI think I'll need to hone in on some suspicious commits and back-port a reversal of the change?  (If that's even the right terminology?)  That should allow me to build and test various reverts without rebooting.\n\nI can hack the diffs manually, as again I have no idea how to meld the idea of \"fedora way\" with \"vanilla way\" for a bisect, and I have no idea how to bisect just one module.  If you can point me to useful fedora-centric websites for this stuff, that would be great, or I'll just hack around and see what I can get to work.\n\nThanks a ton!!  No mythtv recordings going on until this works..."

And I don't know how to make vanilla do anything without running configure, which I don't want to do as it won't give me a \"fedora\" setup :-(  I just don't know the magic commands.  I know all the theory about git, bisect, etc, but not how to actually do it.  If you want to throw a few command examples at me (no explanation needed, just raw commands) that would help, or send me to a good link.\n\nFor right now, I'm working on undoing some git code changes that look nasty manually in mceusb.c and compiling them/testing.  That much I know how to do.  If I have luck I'll report here immediately.\n\nThanks!!"

Bisected regression to\n    commit da6e162d6a4607362f8478c715c797d84d449f8b (\"[media] rc-core:\n    simplify sysfs code\").\n    \n    The regression comes from adding function change_protocol in ir-raw.c.\n    It changes behaviour so that only the protocol enabled by driver's\n    map_name will be active after registration. This breaks user space\n    behaviour, lirc does not get key press signals anymore.\n    \n    Enable lirc protocol by default for ir raw decoders to restore original\n    behaviour.\n    \n    Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org # for v3.17\n    Signed-off-by: Tomas Melin <tomas.melin@iki.fi>\n    Acked-by: David Härdeman <david@hardeman.nu>\n    Signed-off-by: Mauro Carvalho Chehab <mchehab@osg.samsung.com>\n\nPerhaps the fixup is not covering your case, or was not backported to Fedora."

So like you said, it might not be covering my case.  Or it's not the culprit.  Is there a way I can tell if it's applying to me?  Would it be helpful for me to put printk's inside the if's and recompile and see if the code is running?  If you have any pointers on what code paths/values to look for, I can tinker and find out.\n\nThank you so much for taking a moment to share your wisdom, you have set me on a good path of further things to try and I will see if I can't get this fixed and even offer a patch!"

Just reverting to the old method is a kludge.  We'd want to fix the new method to work properly in my use case.  I'm still leaning towards the u64/s64 types being the problem.\n\nI'll report back here with any news.\n\nIn the meantime, any chance my patch can get applied to Fedora 21 stock kernel rpm? :-)"

Which also has the advantage that it does not break when the xserver runs as a regular user (and thus cannot do direct hardware access), something which we are already doing when using gdm or startx under F-22:\nhttp://hansdegoede.livejournal.com/15767.html\n\nAs said work on 2. is progressing upstream and an in kernel driver for the vmmouse has been merged recently. IMHO 2 clearly is the correct solution, so IMHO the solution for this would be to backport the kernel support for this to the F-22 kernel:\n\nhttps://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit?id=8b8be51b4fd365ac5983e117be9d28f427a07b68\n\nSo I'm changing the component for this bug to kernel.\n\nRegards,\n\nHans"

Instead it should get grabbed on the first click, and then only show the guest windows cursor. At leats that is how all other virtual machines work when there is no absolute mouse driver like vmmouse. If vmplayer behaves differently then that really is a vmplayer bug."

The drivers will compete and steal events from oneanother. Better to remove the user-space driver completely. The Kconfig help text is also incorrect w r t the xf86-input-vmmouse version, it should say 13.1.0 instead of 13.0.1. 13.0.99 will become 13.1.0 as soon as testing is finished and we have currently no bugs reported against 13.0.99. Backporting the vmmouse kernel driver should be trivial.\n\n2) The purpose of the vmmouse driver is primarily to reduce cursor lag, particularly on, but not restricted to, remote VMs. The grab / ungrab functionality comes with an extra bonus.\n\n3) IIRC QEMU / KVM also supports the vmmouse. We haven't tested the kernel driver in that configuration so that should probably be done.\n\n4) A small patch is needed for the kernel's joydev.c joystick driver to stop it detecting the vmmouse as a joystick. It should hopefully be in 4.1 when it's released.\n\nThanks,\nThomas"

For the applications, perhaps it only happens when xinput2 is used (Qt5 for example).\n> \n> \n> >  - with xorg-x11-drv-libinput, the mouse wheel always scrolls by one line\n> > regardless of mouse kcm settings\n> \n> The weel motion is currently always presented on the relative vmouse device\n> (there is one absolute and one relative).

It doesn't work in kate with libinput, a bug is already reported (https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1220101), I will post my analysis there.\n> \n> Thanks,\n> Thomas"
