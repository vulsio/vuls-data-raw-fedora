I also noted that the error\ndkms build : make returned bad exit status: 2 ERROR (dkms apport) \"binary package for psmouse: etd1008 not found\"\nwould make more sense if it said\ndkms build : make returned bad exit status: 2 ERROR (dkms apport) \"binary package for psmouse: ****etd0108**** not found\"\nmaybe a wrong command?\nsudo dkms build -m psmouse -v etd0108\n\n2) install sudo apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-$(uname -r) dkms just in case something is missing\n\n3) the dkms commands are so that a new mouse module is built automatically whenever you update your kernel. Perhaps you can try to install the module *once* for the kernel you are using (and then refrain from updating your kernel). Enter the src folder and run\nmake -C /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build M=$(pwd) modules\nmake -C /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build M=$(pwd) modules_install\nthis would build it in the folder and also install it in \n/lib/modules/.../extra/psmouse.ko\nyou should now make sure this specific version is the one loaded. not sure how but I would remove (rename) the original psmouse.ko in /lib/modules/.../drivers/input/mouse/ and replace it with this one. To test without rebooting, rmmod -r psmouse and insmod psmouse.ko from the folder you are in. See also \nhttp://askubuntu.com/questions/515407/how-recipe-to-build-only-one-kernel-module\nif the above in (3) do not work\nGood luck!"

(Strangely enough I can see the login screen and the mouse pointer but everything else is frozen, even ctrl+alt+F2 does not work.) \n\nWhen the external display is switched on during the session, it works, but the computer freezes when I log out. \n\nThis affects both HDMI and VGA outputs.\n\nI am sorry I have not seen it before, but I was travelling and have not used any external display.\n\n\nRegards,\nJanusz"

I've\nalso started a new scratch build in case the above one no longer has the necessary output files:\nhttp://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/taskinfo?taskID=9585410\nNote it will take a while for this build to complete...\n\nSave them all to the same directory (which should not contain other rpms) and do:\n\nsudo rpm -ivh kernel-*.rpm\n\nFrom within that directory.\n\nThen boot into the new kernel (without any special kernel commandline options) and check if the backlight works as expected.\n\nNote this is an F-21 / 3.19 kernel as bug 1206036 is an F-21 bug. If this scratch build fixes things, please also try an unfixed F-21 kernel, e.g. :\n\nhttp://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=629573\n\n(install / test instructions are the same).\n\nIf the scratch-build fixes things, and the regular F-21 build shows the same problems as the F-22 / 4.0 kernel then this is the same bug, and I'll go work on getting the fix included into the regular Fedora kernel builds.\n\nThanks & Regards,\n\nHans"
