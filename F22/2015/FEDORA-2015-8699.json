It works without a problem on 32bit, although it's mitigated by fortify source (edit: I accidentally wrote stack canaries before but meant to say fortify source.)"

Does that make sense?\n\nI've noticed that I've accidentally stated the wrong thing in comment 10. It's not stack canaries, it's fortify source, so the overflow is hard-countered and should not be exploitable, anyways (as long as it's compiled in everywhere, didn't check all our packages yet). I'll do a quick patched test build and see if the assembly looks reasonable when using ushort and if it stops the reproducer."

This bug also tracks the issue in RHEL where it has not been addressed, thus this bug should stay open. You, as a maintainer of the related package in Fedora/EPEL, should only worry about the tracking bugs filed against Fedora or EPEL. Bugs filed against the \"vulnerability\" component can be thought of as metabugs that simply hold general information about the issue, not necessarily its resolution in particular products. Thanks!"

It works without a problem on 32bit, although it's mitigated by fortify source (edit: I accidentally wrote stack canaries before but meant to say fortify source.)"

Does that make sense?\n\nI've noticed that I've accidentally stated the wrong thing in comment 10. It's not stack canaries, it's fortify source, so the overflow is hard-countered and should not be exploitable, anyways (as long as it's compiled in everywhere, didn't check all our packages yet). I'll do a quick patched test build and see if the assembly looks reasonable when using ushort and if it stops the reproducer."

This bug also tracks the issue in RHEL where it has not been addressed, thus this bug should stay open. You, as a maintainer of the related package in Fedora/EPEL, should only worry about the tracking bugs filed against Fedora or EPEL. Bugs filed against the \"vulnerability\" component can be thought of as metabugs that simply hold general information about the issue, not necessarily its resolution in particular products. Thanks!"
