The first issue was originally reported in the following upstream bug:\n\nhttp://bugs.python.org/issue6791\n\nThis bug covers use of readline() without size limit, which can lead to excessive memory usage if a malicious or broken HTTP server sends excessively long lines without any line breaks.  Issue was addressed upstream in the following commit:\n\nhttps://hg.python.org/cpython/rev/0b94635ed2f6\n\nand backported to 2.7 and 3.1 branches:\n\n2.7  https://hg.python.org/cpython/rev/965314f12f71\n3.1  https://hg.python.org/cpython/rev/3c182f71d4c9\n\nThis fix was never backported to 2.6 branch upstream.\n\nMentioned backports to 2.7 and 3.1 missed one readline() call in _read_status().  This is one of the problems covered by the upstream bug:\n\nhttp://bugs.python.org/issue16037\n\nThe missed call was corrected in 2.7 branch in the following commit:\n\n2.7  https://hg.python.org/cpython/rev/8a22a2804a66\n\nThe second issue in the upstream issue16037 is the lack of restriction on the number of HTTP headers server can send.  This issue was fixed upstream in 2.6, 2.7, 3.2 and 3.3 branches:\n\n2.6  https://hg.python.org/cpython/rev/582e5072ff89\n2.7  https://hg.python.org/cpython/rev/5e310c6a8520\n3.3  https://hg.python.org/cpython/rev/e445d02e5306\n\nPatches limit the number of headers to 100.  Exception is raised if server sends more headers."

The first issue was originally reported in the following upstream bug:\n\nhttp://bugs.python.org/issue6791\n\nThis bug covers use of readline() without size limit, which can lead to excessive memory usage if a malicious or broken HTTP server sends excessively long lines without any line breaks.  Issue was addressed upstream in the following commit:\n\nhttps://hg.python.org/cpython/rev/0b94635ed2f6\n\nand backported to 2.7 and 3.1 branches:\n\n2.7  https://hg.python.org/cpython/rev/965314f12f71\n3.1  https://hg.python.org/cpython/rev/3c182f71d4c9\n\nThis fix was never backported to 2.6 branch upstream.\n\nMentioned backports to 2.7 and 3.1 missed one readline() call in _read_status().  This is one of the problems covered by the upstream bug:\n\nhttp://bugs.python.org/issue16037\n\nThe missed call was corrected in 2.7 branch in the following commit:\n\n2.7  https://hg.python.org/cpython/rev/8a22a2804a66\n\nThe second issue in the upstream issue16037 is the lack of restriction on the number of HTTP headers server can send.  This issue was fixed upstream in 2.6, 2.7, 3.2 and 3.3 branches:\n\n2.6  https://hg.python.org/cpython/rev/582e5072ff89\n2.7  https://hg.python.org/cpython/rev/5e310c6a8520\n3.3  https://hg.python.org/cpython/rev/e445d02e5306\n\nPatches limit the number of headers to 100.  Exception is raised if server sends more headers."
