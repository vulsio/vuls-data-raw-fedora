The parser\ndid include bounds checking for the NDEF record payload length, but due\nto insufficient integer size, it was possible to trigger integer\noverflow that would result in bypassing the validation step with some\nmalformed NDEF records.\n\nThis could result in denial of service due to hostapd/wpa_supplicant\nprocess termination (buffer read overflow) or infinite loop. The issue\ncan be triggered only if the NFC stack on the device does not perform\nrequired validation steps for received NFC messages before sending the\nreceived message to hostapd/wpa_supplicant for processing.\n\nIt was possible for the 32-bit record->total_length value to end up\nwrapping around due to integer overflow if the longer form of payload\nlength field is used and record->payload_length gets a value close to\n2^32. This could result in ndef_parse_record() accepting a too large\npayload length value and the record type filter reading up to about 20\nbytes beyond the end of the buffer and potentially killing the process.\nThis could also result in an attempt to allocate close to 2^32 bytes of\nheap memory and if that were to succeed, a buffer read overflow of the\nsame length which would most likely result in the process termination.\nIn case of record->total_length ending up getting the value 0, there\nwould be no buffer read overflow, but record parsing would result in an\ninfinite loop in ndef_parse_records().\n\nAny of these error cases could potentially be used for denial of service\nattacks over NFC by using a malformed NDEF record on an NFC Tag or\nsending them during NFC connection handover if the application providing\nthe NDEF message to hostapd/wpa_supplicant did no validation of the\nreceived NDEF records.
