Setup a host with dual stack v4/v6 to freeipa \n2. Add the AAAA record for the host (As sssd won't add it ...)\n3. Wait\n\nActual results:\nThe AAAA record goes missing.\n\nExpected results:\nThe AAAA should be updated and created in the first place, and should not be removed at minimum. \n\nAdditional info:"
