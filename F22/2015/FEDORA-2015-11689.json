There are few changes that make parsing more strict, but it does not seem the specific attack vector that was reported upstream was made public.  These fixes, in general, apply to all httpd versions as shipped in currently supported Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions.\n\nAssuming the httpd is used as the target host that serves malicious HTTP requests, disabling keep-alive (via KeepAlive Off configuration setting, which is used in the default configuration in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and earlier) will prevent httpd from reading multiple requests from a single TCP connection, and should also prevent it from handling any request that was smuggled through the proxy in front of the httpd.\n\nAs disabling keep-alive may be undesired for performance reasons, alternative way to mitigate this issue is by rejecting connections with requests using chunked encoding.  Unlike chunked encoded HTTP responses, chunked encoded HTTP requests are not believed to be commonly used.  The following mod_rewrite rule will reject requests with Transfer-Encoding: chunked HTTP header:\n\n  RewriteEngine on\n  RewriteCond %{HTTP:Transfer-Encoding} ^chunked$\n  RewriteRule .* - [R=400]\n\nThis rule can be used with httpd versions as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and later.

There are few changes that make parsing more strict, but it does not seem the specific attack vector that was reported upstream was made public.  These fixes, in general, apply to all httpd versions as shipped in currently supported Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions.\n\nAssuming the httpd is used as the target host that serves malicious HTTP requests, disabling keep-alive (via KeepAlive Off configuration setting, which is used in the default configuration in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and earlier) will prevent httpd from reading multiple requests from a single TCP connection, and should also prevent it from handling any request that was smuggled through the proxy in front of the httpd.\n\nAs disabling keep-alive may be undesired for performance reasons, alternative way to mitigate this issue is by rejecting connections with requests using chunked encoding.  Unlike chunked encoded HTTP responses, chunked encoded HTTP requests are not believed to be commonly used.  The following mod_rewrite rule will reject requests with Transfer-Encoding: chunked HTTP header:\n\n  RewriteEngine on\n  RewriteCond %{HTTP:Transfer-Encoding} ^chunked$\n  RewriteRule .* - [R=400]\n\nThis rule can be used with httpd versions as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and later.
