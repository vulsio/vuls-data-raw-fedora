						"thetext": "TLS connections using Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol were found to be vulnerable to an attack, in which a man-in-the-middle attacker could downgrade vulnerable TLS connections to 512-bit export-grade cryptography. The attack affects any server that supports DHE_EXPORT ciphers. This attack can be conduted by  precomputation on the 512 bit primes given in two popular sets of weak Diffie-Hellman parameters, namely Apache 2.1.5 -  2.4.7 and OpenSSL.\n\nThe following attack scenarios are possible:\n\n1. Offline Decryption of Weak DHE Connections:\nThis attack requires that the server default to using a Diffie-Hellman key exchange with 512-bit parameters. In this attack, there is a passive network adversary able to eavesdrop, who can obtain a transcript of the communication between the client and server. \n\n2. DHE_EXPORT Downgrade and Offline Decryption of TLS False Start:\nThis attack only requires that a server support 512-bit parameters, but has a greater requirement of the client and attacker. The server, in this case, only needs to support DHE_EXPORT cipher suites or use 512-bit parameters in non-export DHE ciphers. The client must be using the TLS False Start extension.\n\n3. DHE_EXPORT Downgrade and Man-In-The-Middle Server Impersonation:\nThis is similar to the second attack, but does not need TLS False Start extension to be enabled. We instead require the client be willing to wait a significant amount of time for the handshake to complete. This is because the attacker must compute the connection key during the handshake process, but computing the key takes several minutes.\n\nExternal Reference:\n\nhttps://weakdh.org/\nhttps://access.redhat.com/articles/1456263"

One of the issue is use of DHE_EXPORT ciphersuites in TLS protocol or DHE keys with export cipher strength. These keys are 512 bits in size and given enough computing power and time, they can be broken. This is specially a problem with perfect-forward secrecy, ie enough traffic and be recorded and later decrypted.\n\n2. Another issue is about pre-computed primes, which are stored along with certain critical packages such as certain versions of apache and sshd. This can lead to pre-computation and offer attacker an advantage of compute once, use many to decrypt traffic.\n\n3. The third problem is an issue with the TLS protocol, which can lead to a downgrade from DHE to DHE_EXPORT. This issue has been assigned CVE-2015-4000"

						"thetext": "Fixes and Proposals for OpenSSL:\n===============================\n\nThe current versions of openssl packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7 do not include DHE_EXPORT or any other export grade cipher suite in its DEFAULT cipher list.  Applications that use the DEFAULT cipher preference will not use export cipher suites.  However, application specific configuration may re-enable the use of export ciphers.\n\nThe openssl packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 excluded export cipher suites from the DEFAULT since their initial release.  In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, the change was made via the following advisory released as part of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.6:\nhttps://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2014-1525.html\n\nThis should address the first problem from the above.\n\nSecondly as per:\nhttps://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2015/05/20/logjam-freak-upcoming-changes/\n\n\"OpenSSL clients will reject connections with DH parameters shorter than 768 bits. As an unfortunately large number of servers use 768-bit parameters still, we’ll be giving them a short grace period to upgrade, with a keen eye out to raising the limit to 1024 bits soon. [OpenSSL 1.0.2b (next release), OpenSSL 1.0.1n (next release)]\"\n\nThis should address the the other two issues listed in comment #4\n\nFixes and Proposals for NSS:\n===========================\nCurrently all versions of NSS packages as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux, accept 512 bit DHE parameters. The following upstream bug and related commit claim to fix this issue and raise the limit to 1023 bits.\n\nhttps://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1138554\nhttps://hg.mozilla.org/projects/nss/rev/ae72d76f8d24"

This limit is defined using the jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms security property set in the java.security file.  The specification \"DH keySize < 768\" defines that the use of DH algorithm with keys smaller than 768 bits is not allowed.  The new jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms default value is:\n\n  jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms=SSLv3, DH keySize < 768\n\nIn certain IBM JDK versions, RC4 is disabled too, hence the default value is:\n\n  jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms=SSLv3, RC4, DH keySize < 768\n\nNote that older JDK versions prior to the listed updates do not correctly handle the \"DH keySize < 768\" specification and allow use of smaller DH keys with this setting.  They only allow disabling the use of DH completely, using \"DH\" specification added to the jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms.  Such configuration can be used in OpenJDK 6 and later, Oracle JDK 7 and later, and IBM JDK 7 and later, but is ineffective in Oracle JDK 6 and IBM JDKs 6 and 5.0."

								"thetext": "TLS connections using Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol were found to be vulnerable to an attack, in which a man-in-the-middle attacker could downgrade vulnerable TLS connections to 512-bit export-grade cryptography. The attack affects any server that supports DHE_EXPORT ciphers. This attack can be conduted by  precomputation on the 512 bit primes given in two popular sets of weak Diffie-Hellman parameters, namely Apache 2.1.5 -  2.4.7 and OpenSSL.\n\nThe following attack scenarios are possible:\n\n1. Offline Decryption of Weak DHE Connections:\nThis attack requires that the server default to using a Diffie-Hellman key exchange with 512-bit parameters. In this attack, there is a passive network adversary able to eavesdrop, who can obtain a transcript of the communication between the client and server. \n\n2. DHE_EXPORT Downgrade and Offline Decryption of TLS False Start:\nThis attack only requires that a server support 512-bit parameters, but has a greater requirement of the client and attacker. The server, in this case, only needs to support DHE_EXPORT cipher suites or use 512-bit parameters in non-export DHE ciphers. The client must be using the TLS False Start extension.\n\n3. DHE_EXPORT Downgrade and Man-In-The-Middle Server Impersonation:\nThis is similar to the second attack, but does not need TLS False Start extension to be enabled. We instead require the client be willing to wait a significant amount of time for the handshake to complete. This is because the attacker must compute the connection key during the handshake process, but computing the key takes several minutes.\n\nExternal Reference:\n\nhttps://weakdh.org/\nhttps://access.redhat.com/articles/1456263"

One of the issue is use of DHE_EXPORT ciphersuites in TLS protocol or DHE keys with export cipher strength. These keys are 512 bits in size and given enough computing power and time, they can be broken. This is specially a problem with perfect-forward secrecy, ie enough traffic and be recorded and later decrypted.\n\n2. Another issue is about pre-computed primes, which are stored along with certain critical packages such as certain versions of apache and sshd. This can lead to pre-computation and offer attacker an advantage of compute once, use many to decrypt traffic.\n\n3. The third problem is an issue with the TLS protocol, which can lead to a downgrade from DHE to DHE_EXPORT. This issue has been assigned CVE-2015-4000"

Applications that use the DEFAULT cipher preference will not use export cipher suites.  However, application specific configuration may re-enable the use of export ciphers.\n\nThe openssl packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 excluded export cipher suites from the DEFAULT since their initial release.  In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, the change was made via the following advisory released as part of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.6:\nhttps://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2014-1525.html\n\nThis should address the first problem from the above.\n\nSecondly as per:\nhttps://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2015/05/20/logjam-freak-upcoming-changes/\n\n\"OpenSSL clients will reject connections with DH parameters shorter than 768 bits.

GnuTLS defaults to priority string \"Weak\", thereby setting DHE parameter size as 1008 bits. \n\nHowever GnuTLS allows client applications compiled against it, to change the value of the minimum size of DHE parameters which can be accepted from the server, (post initialization to the above mentioned safe values) by using the gnutls_dh_set_prime_bits() function. A client application can use this function to change the DHE parameter size to any value it desires.\n\nIn Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 (GnuTLS > 3.1) when client applications attempt to set DHE parameter size to a value lower than the one specified by the security level, it results in a warning message in the log files."

This limit is defined using the jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms security property set in the java.security file.  The specification \"DH keySize < 768\" defines that the use of DH algorithm with keys smaller than 768 bits is not allowed.  The new jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms default value is:\n\n  jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms=SSLv3, DH keySize < 768\n\nIn certain IBM JDK versions, RC4 is disabled too, hence the default value is:\n\n  jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms=SSLv3, RC4, DH keySize < 768\n\nNote that older JDK versions prior to the listed updates do not correctly handle the \"DH keySize < 768\" specification and allow use of smaller DH keys with this setting.  They only allow disabling the use of DH completely, using \"DH\" specification added to the jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms.  Such configuration can be used in OpenJDK 6 and later, Oracle JDK 7 and later, and IBM JDK 7 and later, but is ineffective in Oracle JDK 6 and IBM JDKs 6 and 5.0."

If you would still like \nto see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version \nof Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora \nversion prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.\n\nAlthough we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's \nlifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a \nmore recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes \nbugs or makes them obsolete."
