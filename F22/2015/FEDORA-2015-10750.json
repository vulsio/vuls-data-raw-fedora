Whilst it's aims are laudable, it simply promulgates all the bad practices inherent in the hacked and extremely poor vendor specific implementations which have plagued Squashfs for years.\n\nMany of these hacked implementations are full of bugs, and will make Unsquashfs extremely unstable...  In addition Squashfs has a specific filesystem layout, and divergences from that are treated as errors and possible security attack vectors (trying to make Squashfs do something wrong).  To move to a non-deterministic \"guess work\" system where filesystem differences are merely treated as \"hints\" it's been generated by a \"vendor variant\" makes a mockery of any security checks, and the two years of security hardening I put into Squashfs-tools 4.3.\n\nIn otherwords you can either make Squashfs-tools secure from attacks by carefully checking the filesystem is correct, OR you can make Squashfs flexible and tolerant of hacked up vendor messes by using kludges and guess work.  You can't do both.\n\nI think it is outrageous a distribution would even consider moving from the official tools to an entirely unofficial and unendorsed fork.  To make myself clear it is not simply unendorsed, I publically denounce it now."

In terms of vulnerability the kernel is most critical, then Mksquashfs and last Unsquashfs, and the hardening and addition of sanity checks have been prioritised in that order.\n\nThe expected use-case is a little less obvious.  With the kernel code hardening, it has become increasingly impossible to mount a corrupted Squashfs filesystem.  Given we would like to allow users to extract the good data in a corrupted filesystem using Unsquashfs, it stand to reason that Unsquashfs by definition needs to be more tolerant of filesystem corruption and have less sanity checks.\n\nUnfortunately this means Unsquashfs is more vulnerable to CVEs than the other code.\n\nThe question here is what to do about this raised CVE, and what to do in the future.\n\nWith regards to this CVE, the posted patch is a band-aid, it fixes the symptom but not the cause.  The cause is a corrupted fragments superblock entry, the symptom is this value unchecked then leads to a variable overflow and a stack overflow.  The fix isn't to paper over the variable overflow and the stack overflow, this will probably simply lead to incorrect behaviour later on.\n\nOn the one hand the correct fix is obvious, and that is to introduce more sanity checks of the superblock information.  But on the other hand this goes against the idea that Unsquashfs is supposed to be more tolerant of filesystem corruption.\n\nThe ultimate fix in the future is likely to mean making Unsquashfs more actively tolerant of filesystem corruption, rather than at the moment turning a blind eye to filesystem corruption and hoping for the best.  What this means is Unsquashfs will need to actively detect filesystem corruption, and rather than simply aborting, try to actively work around the known filesystem corruption.\n\nTo do this completely is a big task.  In the meantime I will work on a more focused patch for this CVE that fixes the cause and not the symptom."
