There might be a possibility that such allocations blow up the stack. They need to be carefully audited.\n\nI like to keep this bug open till at least those three issues have been fixed.\n\nOf course any new fuzzed data files that cause crashes are also very welcome."

See \"elflint: Add various low-level checks.\"\n\nThe usage of undefined memory comes from the libelf translation functions which cannot convert the full version section data because the version data definitions are corrupt/incomplete. This could lead to a data leak because the buffer is malloced, but not fully filled. I have a patch for that also on the mjw/pending branch \"libelf: Make sure version xlate dest buffer is fully defined.\" but I am not too happy about it. In general it is inefficient and should be unnecessary. But there is no way currently for the translation functions to signal \"failure\" (all other translations are always well defined, only version data seems special)"

I was just pondering about all these unbounded array allocations on the stack in the code. This is an example of one. In this case descsz=8388624 and we have the following in ebl_object_note.c:\n\n uint32_t buf[descsz / 4];\n\nCausing a stack overflow that looks like a crash while calling a function.\n\nBTW. The valgrind output already hints there is something fishy going on here:\n\n==24364== Warning: client switching stacks?  SP change: 0xffefff5f0 --> 0xffe7ff5d0\n\nWhen compiling with gcc -Wstack-usage=65536 these issues are easy to spot as:\n\n/home/mark/src/elfutils/libebl/eblobjnote.c:220:1: error: stack usage might be unbounded [-Werror=stack-usage=]"

So the fix is to add a check to elf_strptr:\n\n  libelf: Make sure string returned by elf_strptr is NUL terminated.\n\nBut before I could fix that I had to fix some other issues:\n\n  libelf: elf_strptr should fetch the shdr for the section if not yet known.\n  libelf: Fix elf_newdata when raw ELF file/image data is available.\n  libelf: elf_strptr should use datalist when data has been added to section.\n\nAll have been posted to the mailinglist and are on the mjw/pending git branch."

Please note that\n> relying on transitive dependency (gcc pulls in glibc-headers) is as wrong as\n> relying already gone minimal build root package list.\n\nYou are not relying on any transitive dependency. The compiler, runtime, and headers form an \"implementation\" which is maintained by the Fedora platform tools team (RHEL BaseOS Platform Tools team). We guarantee that \"BuildRequires: gcc\" will give you exactly what you need to build conforming standard C applications.\n\nThe C library and it's headers are not a stand-alone thing like other packages, they are a special part of a coordinated implementation of a language.\n\n> And what if I need headers because I use cpp only to expand them. Which\n> package should I require?\n\nIs there such a use case? Is there such a package? We can certainly discuss this use case if it exists.\n\nThe problem with such a use case is that glibc-headers is *incomplete* without the compiler headers provided by gcc which are also a required part of the runtime. Therefore if you have this use case today you must require gcc or gcc-c++ to get all of the headers you need.\n\n> I think better approach would be first create stable standard library header\n> RPM Provides symbol, then migrate the packages to require it, and then\n> shuffle the header files wherever you want.\n\nThe bugs I have filed are for packages that don't even need glibc-headers, the BuildRequires has been copied from other spec files without consideration for what is needed. The majority of the 24 packages that require glibc-headers really need to BuildRequires on gcc or gcc-c++.\n\nThere is no immediate need for a stable standard library header RPM provides symbol, but I'm open to discussion if there is a package that needs such a requirement."

A devel package that uses standard's conforming headers need not run-require anything. The final user of the devel package will need a standards conforming compiler to compile the code, and that will bring in the required headers.\n\nHopefully the FPC request is approved and the text there clarifies what packagers should list in their BuildRequires or Requires."
