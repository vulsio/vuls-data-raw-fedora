Additionally, exposure is not prevented by either ACLs or configuration options limiting or denying service because the exploitable code occurs early in the packet handling, before checks enforcing those boundaries.\n\nThis flaw is fixed in upstream versions 9.9.7-P2 and 9.10.2-P3.\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nRed Hat would like to thank ISC for reporting this issue.
