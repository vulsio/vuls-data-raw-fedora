Though the releases don't seem to be security fixes, it would be great to have them in F21/F22 as well.\n\nTo build on F22, I needed to patch the SPEC file, because there's a Mono-4.0 specific modification command in there:\n\nhttp://copr-dist-git.fedorainfracloud.org/cgit/barsnick/fed-newer/keepass.git/commit/?id=0627c0c09ce0c3402c68b519a09ca67cb9f85db3\n\nThis is my corresponding copr build:\nhttps://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/barsnick/fed-newer/build/109456/\n\nWorks fine so far for me (basic usage) on x86_64.\n\n(Build fails on ppc64le due to a missing ExcludeArch, but I fail to find a ruling on that in the Mono packaging guidelines.)"

That's my biggest issue...\n\nI am hoping v2.30 works better, menus continue to work properly even when you open other programs and then navigate back to keepass which was already open.\n\nIf you have not tried it... Open keepass, than open Firefox, thunderbird or open the system settings window (basically open a few other programs) and then go back to keepass (which you openned first).  Under the v2.26 (F22) I find that the dropdowns work but you can't click on anything if other programs or windows have been opened after keepass.  Continuing on with keyboard commands works for awhile but that even get's corrupted after a while.\n\nIf keepass v2.26 is the only thing open it seems to work fine... but the irony is it's a password manager so of course we want to be able to use it for things we are doing in other programs...  thus, my biggest problem."
