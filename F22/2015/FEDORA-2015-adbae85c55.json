It is Fedora's policy to close all\nbug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time\nthis bug will be closed as WONTFIX if it remains open with a Fedora \n'version' of '16'.\n\nPackage Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you\nplan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version' \nto a later Fedora version prior to Fedora 16's end of life.\n\nBug Reporter: Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that \nwe may not be able to fix it before Fedora 16 is end of life. If you \nwould still like to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it \nagainst a later version of Fedora, you are encouraged to click on \n\"Clone This Bug\" and open it against that version of Fedora.\n\nAlthough we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's \nlifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a \nmore recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes \nbugs or makes them obsolete.\n\nThe process we are following is described here: \nhttp://fedoraproject.org/wiki/BugZappers/HouseKeeping"

I could reproduce this with both X session started from *dm (lxdm in my case) as well as X server started manually from the text console.

User2 sets DISPLAY to :0 and can connect to User1's X session - start new X apps or use xwd to steal info (it seems session has to be active / displayed for at least xwd -root to work).\n\nActual results:\n\nUser2 is allowed to connect to User1's X session.\n\nExpected results:\n\nxterm: Xt error: Can't open display: :0"
