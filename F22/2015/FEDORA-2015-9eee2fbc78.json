						"thetext": "Hi,\n\nI was having trouble setting up NFS on atomic host (http://www.projectatomic.io/). It turns out that there is a problem when rpcbind is trying to find the uid of the rpc user. OSTree based operating systems store user information for systems users such as the rpc user in /usr/lib/passwd and leaves /etc/passwd for humans users. This is achieved by the use the nss module nss-altfiles (https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/nss-altfiles) which allows one to specify additional files to be added the the passwd database. rpcbind however overrides the rule added to /etc/nsswitch.conf and removes altfiles by doing the following:\n \n    __nss_configure_lookup(\"passwd\", \"files\");\n\nThis is done presumably to avoid checking remote users, but I was wondering if its possible to add altfiles as follows:\n\n~~~~~~\n--- src/rpcbind.c\n+++ src/rpcbind.c\n@@ -226,7 +226,7 @@ main(int argc, char *argv[])\n \t\t * Make sure we use the local password file\n \t\t * for these lookups.\n \t\t */\n-\t\t__nss_configure_lookup(\"passwd\", \"files\");\n+\t\t__nss_configure_lookup(\"passwd\", \"files altfiles\");\n \n \t\tif((p = getpwnam(id)) == NULL) {\n \t\t\tsyslog(LOG_ERR, \"cannot get uid of '%s': %m\", id);\n\n~~~~~~\n\nIf altfiles is not present it is simply ignored\n\nWDYT ?"

First, we have:\n\nhttp://git.infradead.org/users/steved/rpcbind.git/commit/8d7a0708f14b22df100d64bcadfb66598052a950\n\nA patch from a Gentoo developer to clean up the autotools, and notably drops the HAVE_NSS_H check.\n\nNext we have:\n\nhttp://git.infradead.org/users/steved/rpcbind.git/commitdiff/c4814d539434391df4dfa61551e5e2e96947326d?hp=86036582c001e99075f4d74cb3829df39f2a9ddf\n\nA patch from a different Gentoo developer which relies on the HAVE_NSS_H check that was removed a little more than two years (!) earlier.  Of course, in between there were a grand total of 9 commits.\n\nAbout a half a year later, we have the commit for this bug:\n\nhttp://git.infradead.org/users/steved/rpcbind.git/commit/d30515b11bea3171b2ba0373f0eda132992538b7\n\nI'm sure Sami tested it, and noticed it worked, but because he was forward-porting a patch, didn't notice it worked *without* his patch too.\n\nAnyways so, two action items:\n\n1) Reintroduce the HAVE_NSS_H check in configure.ac\n2) Fix the Fedora spec file as Sami says in comment #10"

I tested this agian to make sure. Unless I am missing something rpcbind only starts with the patch to the specfile adding altfiles. As far as I can tell HAVE_NSS is only used to decide whether to define the __nss_configure_lookup function prototype if the header is not available to define it.\n\nSo the only patch which is needed is attachment 955950"

								"thetext": "A use-after-free vulnerability in rpcbind causing remotely triggerable crash was found. Rpcbind crashes in svc_dodestroy when trying to free a corrupted xprt->xp_netid pointer, which contains a sockaddr_in. Here's how it happens (as explained in http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-nfs/msg53045.html ) :\n\n - A PMAP_CALLIT call comes in on IPv4 UDP\n\n - rpcbind duplicates the caller's address to a netbuf and stores\n\tit in FINFO[0].caller_addr. caller_addr->buf now points to a\n    memory region A with a size of 16 bytes\n\n - rpcbind forwards the call to the local service, receives a reply\n\n - when processing the reply, it does this in xprt_set_caller:\n     xprt->xp_rtaddr = *FINFO[0].caller_addr\n   where xprt is the UDP transport on which it received the\n   PMAP_CALLIT request.\n\n   It sends out the reply, and then frees the netbuf caller_addr and\n   caller_addr.buf.\n   However, it does not clear xp_rtaddr, so xp_rtaddr.buf now refers\n   to memory region A, which is free.\n\n - When the next call comes in on the UDP/IPv4 socket, svc_dg_recv\n   will be called, which will set xp_rtaddr to the client's address.\n   It will reuse the buffer inside xp_rtaddr, ie it will write a\n   sockaddr_in to region A.\n\nSo, this explains how memory gets corrupted. Here's why that \neventually lead to a crash in svc_dodestroy.\n\nSome time down the road, an incoming TCP connection is accepted,\nallocating a fresh SVCXPRT. The memory region A is inside the\nnew SVCXPRT\n\n - While processing the TCP call, another UDP call comes in, again\n   overwriting region A with the client's address\n\n - TCP client closes connection. In svc_destroy, we now trip over\n   the garbage left in region A\n\nCVE assignment:\n\nhttp://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q3/566"
