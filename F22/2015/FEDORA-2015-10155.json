						"thetext": "http://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20150617A.html\n\nVULNERABILITY\n\nlibcurl can wrongly send HTTP credentials when re-using connections.\n\nlibcurl allows applications to set credentials for the upcoming transfer with HTTP Basic authentication, like with CURLOPT_USERPWD for example. Name and password. Just like all other libcurl options the credentials are sticky and are kept associated with the \"handle\" until something is made to change the situation.\n\nFurther, libcurl offers a curl_easy_reset() function that resets a handle back to its pristine state in terms of all settable options. A reset is of course also supposed to clear the credentials. A reset is typically used to clear up the handle and prepare it for a new, possibly unrelated, transfer.\n\nWithin such a handle, libcurl can also store a set of previous connections in case a second transfer is requested to a host name for which an existing connection is already kept alive.\n\nWith this flaw present, using the handle even after a reset would make libcurl accidentally use those credentials in a subseqent request if done to the same host name and connection as was previously accessed.\n\nAn example case would be first requesting a password protected resource from one section of a web site, and then do a second request of a public resource from a completely different part of the site without authentication. This flaw would then inadvertently leak the credentials in the second request.\n\nWe are not aware of any exploit of this flaw.\nINFO\n\nThis flaw can also affect the curl command line tool if a similar operation series is made with that.\n\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name CVE-2015-3236 to this issue.\nAFFECTED VERSIONS\n\nThis flaw is relevant for\n\n    Affected versions: libcurl 7.40.0 to and including 7.42.1\n    Not affected versions: libcurl < 7.40.0 and libcurl >= 7.43.0\n\nlibcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such!\nTHE SOLUTION\n\nIn version 7.43.0, libcurl properly clears the credentials and prevents them from lingering around.\n\nA patch for this problem that changes the default is available at (URL will be updated in final advisory):\n\nhttp://curl.haxx.se/CVE-2015-3236.patch\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nRed Hat would like to thank curl upstream for reporting this issue.

								"thetext": "http://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20150617A.html\n\nVULNERABILITY\n\nlibcurl can wrongly send HTTP credentials when re-using connections.\n\nlibcurl allows applications to set credentials for the upcoming transfer with HTTP Basic authentication, like with CURLOPT_USERPWD for example. Name and password. Just like all other libcurl options the credentials are sticky and are kept associated with the \"handle\" until something is made to change the situation.\n\nFurther, libcurl offers a curl_easy_reset() function that resets a handle back to its pristine state in terms of all settable options. A reset is of course also supposed to clear the credentials. A reset is typically used to clear up the handle and prepare it for a new, possibly unrelated, transfer.\n\nWithin such a handle, libcurl can also store a set of previous connections in case a second transfer is requested to a host name for which an existing connection is already kept alive.\n\nWith this flaw present, using the handle even after a reset would make libcurl accidentally use those credentials in a subseqent request if done to the same host name and connection as was previously accessed.\n\nAn example case would be first requesting a password protected resource from one section of a web site, and then do a second request of a public resource from a completely different part of the site without authentication. This flaw would then inadvertently leak the credentials in the second request.\n\nWe are not aware of any exploit of this flaw.\nINFO\n\nThis flaw can also affect the curl command line tool if a similar operation series is made with that.\n\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name CVE-2015-3236 to this issue.\nAFFECTED VERSIONS\n\nThis flaw is relevant for\n\n    Affected versions: libcurl 7.40.0 to and including 7.42.1\n    Not affected versions: libcurl < 7.40.0 and libcurl >= 7.43.0\n\nlibcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such!\nTHE SOLUTION\n\nIn version 7.43.0, libcurl properly clears the credentials and prevents them from lingering around.\n\nA patch for this problem that changes the default is available at (URL will be updated in final advisory):\n\nhttp://curl.haxx.se/CVE-2015-3236.patch\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nRed Hat would like to thank curl upstream for reporting this issue.
