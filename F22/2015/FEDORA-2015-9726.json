There is indeed a difference between how NVD rates things and how we rate things.  This is described on the Security Blog here:\n\nhttps://securityblog.redhat.com/2013/02/13/how-red-hat-uses-cvssv2-scoring-to-assist-in-rating-flaws/\n\nThat should clarify things for you."

						"thetext": "In addition to what Huzaifa noted above, this flaw requires that CUPS be listening to a network interface connected to the internet for it to be exploited by the general public.  Typically, most CUPS installs listen to the localhost only (so the machine CUPS is running on) which is the shipped default.  In cases of running a print server, this would listen on an ethernet interface but even then, unless there is a reason for having someone on the other side of the world print to your printer, there are firewalls in place to prevent unknown entities from performing an attack, which leaves only attackers on your local network.\n\nIn addition, this flaw requires that the CUPS web interface is also listening on a network-reachable port (again, by default, only the localhost).  Note that just because you have CUPS listening for print requests on the local network it does not automatically mean that the web UI is available (this can be locked down to the localhost while still allowing for network printing).\n\nAs a result, this can be very easily mitigated even if you are using non-default configuration changes (which can only be made by a user with root privileges).  If you need to permit web-based configuration via the UI, you can easily lock it down to a particular administrator IP (using either CUPS itself or iptables).  See http://cups.org/documentation.php/doc-1.3/policies.html for more details."

There is indeed a difference between how NVD rates things and how we rate things.  This is described on the Security Blog here:\n\nhttps://securityblog.redhat.com/2013/02/13/how-red-hat-uses-cvssv2-scoring-to-assist-in-rating-flaws/\n\nThat should clarify things for you."

Typically, most CUPS installs listen to the localhost only (so the machine CUPS is running on) which is the shipped default.  In cases of running a print server, this would listen on an ethernet interface but even then, unless there is a reason for having someone on the other side of the world print to your printer, there are firewalls in place to prevent unknown entities from performing an attack, which leaves only attackers on your local network.\n\nIn addition, this flaw requires that the CUPS web interface is also listening on a network-reachable port (again, by default, only the localhost).  Note that just because you have CUPS listening for print requests on the local network it does not automatically mean that the web UI is available (this can be locked down to the localhost while still allowing for network printing).\n\nAs a result, this can be very easily mitigated even if you are using non-default configuration changes (which can only be made by a user with root privileges).  If you need to permit web-based configuration via the UI, you can easily lock it down to a particular administrator IP (using either CUPS itself or iptables).  See http://cups.org/documentation.php/doc-1.3/policies.html for more details."
