						"thetext": "This problem is in the decode_udp_ip_header() function.  The function receives a buffer pointer buf and its length in buflen.  It then computes endbuf pointing to after the end of the buffer as:\n\n  endbuf = buf + bufix + buflen;\n\n(bufix is index where buffer parsing should start.  If bufix is non-0, function caller is responsible for ensuring that buflen does not indicate full buffer size, but full size minus bufix.  We will ignore bufix in the following discussion as it's not relevant for this issue.)\n\nSubsequently, the function does boundary checks using endbuf using code that can be simplified to:\n\n  if (buf + offset > endbuf)\n    return error;\n\nThe buf + offset addition may overflow / wraparound under certain circumstances, leading to the bypass of the boundary checks, resulting in out of bounds read which can cause dhcp do crash as reported in the upstream advisory.\n\nThe offset is attacker controlled, as it contains values read from the packet being parsed.  However, its maximum value is very limited - it can only be around 64k (2^16), derived from the maximum UDP packet length.  Therefore for wraparound to happen, buf needs to be placed close to the address space limit.  Its end - indicated by endbuf - should be above ~ (2^32 - 2^16) or ~ (2^64 - 2^16) depending on the architecture.\n\nAs buf is stack based, that is theoretically possible.  However, part of the address space is normally not accessible to user space application and is reserved for kernel.  E.g. on i386, there's 3:1 memory split, leaving the topmost 1gb of memory reserved for kernel.  Similarly, on x86_64 and other architectures, stack memory is placed far from the end of the address space.  In those cases, wraparound can not happen and hence they are not affected by this problem.\n\nThis may be an issue when running 32bit application on 64bit system as memory reserved for kernel is above 2^32.  In such case, stack memory can be placed close enough to the end of address space to possibly allow triggering of this problem.  ASLR (address space layout randomization) is likely to cause only some invocations of the program to be affected and other having stack memory end far enough from the address space end.  As Red Hat does not provide 32bit dhcp packages builds for 64bit versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7, this is not relevant for the Red Hat provided and supported versions of dhcp."
