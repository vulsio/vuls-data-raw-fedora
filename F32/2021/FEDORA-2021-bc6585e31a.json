The patch introduces a function called `_safe_size()` which performs the calculations whilst preventing unsigned integer wrap in the result.\n\nBecause the above calculations are used in allocation of heap memory, the flaw can lead to arbitrary heap memory write in subsequent code when specially crafted input is provided to CImg. It is more likely to occur on platforms where the `size_t` type is 32-bit."
