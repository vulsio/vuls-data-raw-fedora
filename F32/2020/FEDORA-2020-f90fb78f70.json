Indeed the paper authors mention that this may not be sufficient to counter other future attacks, and they are correct in that. How critical however would be such future attacks? For that one must note what is the actual impact of this attack. This type of attacks does only affect the legacy HMAC-based ciphersuites  and only when the gnutls peer does not implement the encrypt-then-mac construction. That's why the majority of HMAC ciphersuites are now disabled by default keeping HMAC-SHA1 for compatibility only."
