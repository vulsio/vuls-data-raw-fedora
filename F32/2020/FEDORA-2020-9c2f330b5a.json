That seems almost consistent with the patch offered here (well, HOST_NAME_MAX+1 is 65, but as noted 63+1=64 should be enough in practice). I plan to backport a patch based on the 3.1 code in the next few days, and release it as a security update for all supported Fedora versions.\n\nAfter that, I will work on https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1857980, packaging version 3.1. It will take a little time to review the changes and figure out which patches need to be carried forward.\n\nThanks for reporting this, and for keeping the bug report updated."
