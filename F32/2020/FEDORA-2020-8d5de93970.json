Bentkowski](https://twitter.com/securitymb) of Securitum.\n\n\tIssue summary: It was possible to execute XSS inside CKEditor after persuading the victim to: (i) switch CKEditor to source mode, then (ii) paste a specially crafted HTML code, prepared by the attacker, into the opened CKEditor source area, and (iii) switch back to WYSIWYG mode or (i) copy the specially crafted HTML code, prepared by the attacker and (ii) paste it into CKEditor in WYSIWYG mode.\n\n* [CVE-2020-9440](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-9440) Fixed XSS vulnerability in the WebSpellChecker Dialog plugin reported

source mode, then (ii) paste a specially crafted HTML code, prepared by the attacker, into the opened CKEditor source area, then (iii) switch back to WYSIWYG mode, and (iv) preview CKEditor content outside CKEditor editable area.\n\n**An upgrade is highly recommended!**\n\nNew features:\n\n* [#2374](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/2374): Added support for pasting rich content from LibreOffice Writer with the [Paste from LibreOffice](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/pastefromlibreoffice) plugin.\n* [#2583](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/2583): Changed

button](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/colorbutton) state to reflect the selected editor content colors.\n* [#3661](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/3661): Improved the [Print](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/print) plugin to respect styling rendered by the [Preview](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/preview) plugin.\n* [#3547](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/3547): Active [dialog](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/dialog) tab now has the `aria-selected=\"true\"` attribute.\n* [#3441](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/3441): Improved [`widget.getClipboardHtml()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_plugins_widget.html#method-getClipboardHtml) support for dragging and dropping multiple [widgets](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/widget).\n\nFixed Issues:\n\n* [#3587](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/3587): [Edge, IE] Fixed: [Widget](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/widget) with form input elements loses focus during typing.\n* [#3705](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/3705): [Safari] Fixed: Safari incorrectly removes blocks with the [`editor.extractSelectedHtml()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#method-extractSelectedHtml) method after selecting all content.\n* [#1306](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/1306): Fixed: The [Font](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/font) plugin creates nested HTML `<span>` tags when reapplying the same font multiple
