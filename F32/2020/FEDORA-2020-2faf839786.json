Udev takes several minutes to detect all devices. After I'm finally able to login, I have to wait for several minutes before network and audio become operational.\nOther symptoms: worker threads, mainly efi_rts_wq and unbound_event, load cpu a lot, around 20 instances of systemd-udevd run. Restarting dbus.service removes that cpu usage and udev processes (but that causes gtk based applications start slowly under KDE session).\n\nMy hardware:\nASUS N56VB laptop\nCPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3630QM CPU @ 2.40GHz\nRAM: 16GB\nHDD: Samsung SSD 860 EVO 2TB\n\nI tried loading kernels left from fedora 31 (5.6.8, 5.6.7), but that didn't help.\n\nUpdate: plugging or removing usb devices causes kworker threads to eat cpu for several seconds and system does not detect the device (or it's disconnect) for that period\n\nVersion-Release number of selected component (if applicable):\nsystemd-245.4-1.fc32.x86_64\n\nHow reproducible:\nalways\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.\n2.\n3.\n\nActual results:\n\n\nExpected results:\n\n\nAdditional info:"

The last two caused slowdown the most. I moved those 3 files to my home folder and remade the initrd using dracut.

There is an interesting conversation started about using a hwdb which I'll help with - but if that gates this fix we'll have to pull the P1G2 Fedora ship until a solution is available - I'm hoping we can work on that implementation separately :)\n\nLet me know if any concerns/questions/etc.\n\nVersion-Release number of selected component (if applicable): -\n\n\nHow reproducible: 100%\n\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Perform E8.0 certification test\n2. Confirm that eTec result exceeds maximum permissible\n3. Change the power settings for the two USB devices\n4> Repeat cert test and confirm now passing\n\nActual results: Failed E cert test\n\n\nExpected results: Passed E-cert test\n\n\nAdditional info: N/A"

When I draw a circle with my finger on the touchpad, the cursor moves in a vertical ellipse on the screen.\n\nI think it's because libinput assumes an incorrect size. The command \"sudo libinput list-devices\" reports a size of 77x107 mm, but I measured with a ruler that it is 100x68 mm (WxH) (NotebookCheck.net measured 100x70 mm [1])\n\nThe touchpad didn't work perfectly under Fedora 31 (kernel 5.3.7-301.fc31, libinput 1.14.1-1.fc31) either, but better. The above command reported a size of 70x50 mm there (the ratio of width to height is correct here, which explains why the touchpad worked better then).\n\n[1]: https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-ThinkPad-T490-i7-MX250-Low-Power-FHD-Laptop-Review.421150.0.html\n\n\nVersion-Release number of selected component (if applicable):\n\nkernel 5.6.19-300.fc32\nlibinput libinput-1.15.5-1.fc32"
