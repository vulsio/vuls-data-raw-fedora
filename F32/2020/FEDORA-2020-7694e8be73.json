This is not the case sometimes, because function xmlSchemaValidateStream(), after having called xmlSchemaSAXPlug(), also calls xmlSchemaVStart() which calls again xmlSchemaPreRun(). As said, this last function initially sets `vctxt->xsiAssemble = 0;`, thus preventing the code to free the previously allocated schema."
