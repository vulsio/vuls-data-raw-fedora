The function reads 300 bytes at a time from the input device into `buf` and then uses the pointer `p` to locate and parse hex data from within the buffer. Although the code checks for whether `p` is NULL, it does not check that `p` is inside of the bounds of `buf`. Since `p` is incremented in the loop, and the exit condition is based off of the height value of the XBM, it is possible for a buffer overread to occur due to a crafted height value where `p` is passed to hex2byte() or strstr().\n\nThe patch ensures on every iteration of the loop that `p` does not go out of bounds of `buf` and a check for whether the third and fourth chars are hex digits (i.e. 0x3A and not 0x*%) was also added. There is a hardcoded buflen of 300, and the patch's commit message notes that this leaves parsing of lines longer than this unreliable."
