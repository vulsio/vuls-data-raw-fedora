However, the check is flawed and doesn't properly check for when the options are used in the reversed order: first using -J and then -i were mistakenly accepted.\n~~~\n\nTo me, that suggests the sky isn't falling because you have to use \"-J -i\" (in that order) along with -O.  If you're not using \"-J\" or not using \"-i\" or using \"-i\" before \"-J\" then you're not vulnerable."
