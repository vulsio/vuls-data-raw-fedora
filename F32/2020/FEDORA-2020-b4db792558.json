								"thetext": "====Technical Summary====\n\nThe libexif library parses an EXIF tag called a MakerNote. According to the EXIF standard[1], a MakerNote tag can hold manufacturer-specific data from camera manufacturers such as Nikon, Olympus, Canon, Panasonic, etc... The vulnerable component for this flaw is in the parsing code for the MakerNotes specific to Canon, Fujifilm, Olympus, and Pentax. More precisely, the parsing code was able to read in MakerNote tag data past the end of the input buffer due to either integer overflow in multiplication, or corrupt MakerNote tags which were too short or too long. The patch (see gsuckevi's comment above) appears to check for integer overflow due to multiplication and also verify that the MakerNote tag being parsed matches the size specified in the entry structure's \"components\" member, as each tag can have multiple components within it. On the patch commit, Upstream notes that \"Likely, this makes both commits 41bd042 and 89e5b1c redundant as it ensures that MakerNote entries are well-formed when they're populated,\" because those earlier commits addressed the issues on a per-component basis, whereas the patch for this flaw addresses them in the parser and is likely more robust.\n\nIn summary, this flaw could be exploited if an attacker edits EXIF data in a media file to include malformed MakerNote tag data, which would cause the libexif MakerNote tag parser to perform and out-of-bounds read, potentially exposing unintended data in the process memory or causing a crash, resulting in denial of service.\n\n1. https://www.exif.org/Exif2-2.PDF"

								"thetext": "Technical Summary:\n\nThe libexif library parses an EXIF tag called a MakerNote. According to the EXIF standard[1], a MakerNote tag can hold manufacturer-specific data from camera manufacturers such as Nikon, Olympus, Canon, Panasonic, etc... the vulnerable libexif component parses these MakerNote tags into \"entry\" structures which can contain multiple \"components.\" There is some code duplication in libexif, related parsing MakerNotes, so the same flaw is seen in 4 separate files: libexif/canon/exif-mnote-data-canon.c, libexif/fuji/exif-mnote-data-fuji.c, libexif/olympus/exif-mnote-data-olympus.c , and  libexif/pentax/exif-mnote-data-pentax.c.\n\nUsing the code in exif-mnote-data-canon.c as an example,\n\nMakerNote Entry memory was allocated with n->entries = exif_mem_alloc(ne->mem, sizeof (MnoteCanonEntry) * c) but the entries were not initialized to 0. This could cause the dereference of an uninitialized wild pointer when the entry's data member is accessed later in the program, for example, by the exif_mnote_data_canon_clear() routine, which attempts to free the entries. This could also lead to a use-after-free. The current upstream patch uses memset to zero-initialize entries memory after allocation.\n\nExploitation of the flaw would require an attacker to provide crafted input within EXIF data and submit it to be parsed by libexif. In cases where libexif parses untrusted files, an attacker may be unauthenticated or have low privileges."
