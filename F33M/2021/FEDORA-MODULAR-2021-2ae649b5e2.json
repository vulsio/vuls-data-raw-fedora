These tokens are supposed to be granted to a specific applications (e.g. DAV sync clients), and can also be configured by the user to not have any filesystem access. Due to a lacking permission check, the tokens were able to change their own permissions in versions prior to 19.0.13, 20.0.11, and 21.0.3. Thus fileystem limited tokens were able to grant themselves access to the filesystem. The issue is patched in versions 19.0.13, 20.0.11, and 21.0.3.

In versions prior to 19.0.13, 20.0.11, and 21.0.3, filenames where not escaped by default in controllers using `DownloadResponse`. When a user-supplied filename was passed unsanitized into a `DownloadResponse`, this could be used to trick users into downloading malicious files with a benign file extension. This would show in UI behaviours where Nextcloud applications would display a benign file extension (e.g. JPEG), but the file will actually be downloaded with an executable file extension. The vulnerability is patched in versions 19.0.13, 20.0.11, and 21.0.3. Administrators of Nextcloud instances do not have a workaround available, but developers of Nextcloud apps may manually escape the file name before passing it into `DownloadResponse`.\n\nReference:\nhttps://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-3hjp-26x8-mhf6"
