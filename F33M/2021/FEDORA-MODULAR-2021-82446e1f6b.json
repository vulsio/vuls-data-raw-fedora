						"thetext": "Created attachment 1770474\nPatch to fix issue\n\nDescription of problem:\n\nIf %_topdir contains spaces, then RPM package builds produce errors when calculating perl dependencies.  These errors appear to be non-fatal (the RPM builds run to completion), but given the nature of the problem it does seem possible that the perl dependencies are not being deduced correctly.\n\nThe issue is simple: /usr/lib/rpm/perl.req contains a readpipe call to \"$prov_script $file\", which is interpreted by the shell, without properly quoting or escaping its $file argument.\n\nI've attached a patch which fixes this, patched and tested against Fedora 33.  The patch is simple: it puts single quotes around the argument $file in the readpipe() call to stop the shell splitting the $file argument (or indeed doing other unwanted substitutions/code-calling/etc.).  Since $file might also contain single quotes, I've added a substitution regex beforehand that replaces each ' with '\"'\"' so that the shell picks up any single quotes correctly.\n\nHow reproducible:\n\nConsistently reproducible; just use a topdir with spaces and then build any spec file that includes perl scripts.\n\nAdditional info:\n\nFor me at least the bug was practical, not just theoretical - I encountered this when building Fedora packages in a continuous integration system, where the RPM build directories were beneath machine-specific directories with names such as \"Fedora 33\", \"Fedora 32\", etc."
