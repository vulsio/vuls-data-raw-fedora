						"thetext": "Quoting from the report I sent upstream:\n\nlxdm does not restart X server after user log out.  It also does not\nseem to do anything to revoke granted authorizations.  So the\nfollowing attack is possible on multi-user systems:\n\n- User1 logs in via lxdm.  During the session start up, authentication\n  cookie is copied to user1's .Xauthority.\n- User1 logs out.\n- As X server is not restarted and X server authentication cookies are\n  not regenerated, user1 can still connect via text console or remotely\n  via SSH and start X applications on the X server.\n- No authentication cookie change happens after log in of some other\n  user2, so user1 can also mess with user2's session.\n\nBesides MIT-MAGIC authentication cookies, there are other\nauthorizations that may need to be cleaned up.  For example, user1 can\nrun 'xhost +si:localuser:`id -un`' while they are logged in.  That\nmakes X server accept connections from given local user regardless of\nwhether they have valid cookie or not.  This authorization is also not\nrevoked after user log out.\n\nAt least in Fedora, 'xhost +si:localuser:`id -un`' is run when\ninitializing user's X session.\n\nVersion-Release number of selected component (if applicable):\n\nTested with 0.4.1 in F22, but also with the 0.5.1-7.D20151007gite8f38708 from master rebuilt for F22."

This functionality is available in Fedora 0.4.1 packages.\n\nUpstream also explained they default to no X restart to have faster and smoother logout.  The issue is also pretty minor on single user machines.  However, I'm not convinced Fedora should only assume it's only used in such use cases and default to safer reset=1.  I see other *DMs (gdm, kdm, lightdm) do X restarts as well."

When I input a correct user name and password on the LXDM login screen, everything on the screen (except for the background image) briefly disappears, but after ~1 second the big \"Login:\" text, the username text input box, and the session/language selection bar near the bottom re-appears.\n\nI'm normally using LXDE, but the same thing happens regardless of which X session I select, which makes me believe that this isn't a problem with the desktop environments / X sessions, but with LXDM itself. This assumption is further strengthened by the fact that I can work around the problem by simply downgrading LXDM (see below).\n\nI am certain that LXDM is able to validate the password correctly. If I intentionally enter an incorrect password, the big \"Login:\" text and the session/language selection bar does not briefly vanish, so the observed behaviour is differs between using a correct password and an incorrect one.\n\nThe user in question can log in normally on the text console without any problems.\n\nVersion-Release number of selected component (if applicable):\n\nlxdm-0.5.1-7-D20151007gite8f38708.fc23.x86_64\n\nHow reproducible:\n\n100%\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Attempt to log in as a regular user on the LXDM login screen\n\nActual results:\n\nLogin fails, and the login screen re-appears within a second or so.\n\nExpected results:\n\nLogin is successful.\n\nAdditional info:\n\nSELinux is disabled, so this is not a duplicate of bug #1274169.\n\nIn LXDM's journal I can see it complains about not being able to open /usr/lib64/security/pam_gnome_keyring.so, which is not present on the system. Uncommenting the two relevant lines from /etc/pam.d/lxdm causes those errors to no longer appear, but other than that does not change anything. When attempting to log in with pam_gnome_keyring.so disabled, the following two lines appear in the LXDM journal:\n\npam_unix(lxdm:auth): authentication failure; logname= uid=0 euid=0 tty= ruser= rhost= user=tore\npam_sss(lxdm:auth): authentication success; logname= uid=0 euid=0 tty= ruser= rhost= user=tore\n\nThat pam_unix.so doesn't find the user is expected, since it's stored in an external LDAP tree, not in /etc/passwd. The user's home directory is a remote NFS mount.\n\nDowngrading to lxdm-0.4.1-10.fc22.x86_64 solves the problem and allows me to log in to the system again. (I do not have to downgrade any other packages in order to make this happen.)"

Is it possible that lxdm is updating the file on local file system just to have it hidden by NFS mounted directory and hence inaccessible to your DE?

Of course, /tmp is a poor choice, as (based on a quick look) the code does not protect against symlink attacks.  So /var/run/lxdm/ would be safer if it can be used, i.e. if the code creating Xauthority file is run with sufficient privileges (I've not checked).\n\n(In reply to Tore Anderson from comment #2)\n> The very interesting thing is that if I log back out, remount the NFS on\n> /home/tore (from the console), I can successfully log back in.

In Fedora, xhost +si:localuser:`id -un` is run by xinit and lxdm does not restart X server between sessions (see bug 1269917), so the localuser authorization stays even after session logout, which has its own set of security concerns."

I did some more tests based on the information you added.\n\nFirst, I made a directory \"/rootonly\" to which only root has write access:\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 nov.  20 11:30 /rootonly\n\nThen I set \"xauth_path=/rootonly\" in lxdm.conf, upgraded to lxdm-0.5.1-7.D20151007gite8f38708.fc23.x86_64, and restarted LXDM. The NFS home directory was already mounted at this point.\n\nI attempted to log in, which succeeded. The following file was created:\n\n-rw------- 1 tore tore 71 nov.  20 11:30 /rootonly/.Xauth7097\n\nFrom this we can surmise that the code that wrote this .Xauth7097 file was running as root (otherwise it would have been unable to create any file inside /rootonly/).\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, this is doomed to fail when the directory in question is on a NFS (except if the NFS is exported with the non-default option no_root_squash, cf. exports(5)). This is because the root user has no special \"can freely write everywhere\" privilege on NFS mounts. Thus, in order for LXDE to support creating Xauthority files inside users' home directories, it must drop prileges to the user about to log in before it writes the file.\n\nI must admit I don't fully understand why commit e8f3870 breaks this, as it seems be about files inside /var/run/lxdm (which is not on NFS and has never been), but then again, I'm not familiar with the surrounding code."

Before and after the commit, client default is still ~/.Xauthority.  The difference is that before that commit, X server is not started with -auth argument, and therefore accepts connection from any user able to connect to it, even without having valid authentication cookie.  Therefore, failure to create ~/.Xauthority is not fatal.  Apps in your X session can't provide X server with valid cookie, but it happily accepts their connections anyway.  After the commit, X server is started with -auth argument and hence refuses connections without valid cookie."
