In particular, for all of XENMEM_increase_reservation, XENMEM_populate_physmap, and XENMEM_exchange the order was limited to 9 only for guests without physical devices assigned. Guests with assigned devices were allowed up to order 18 (x86) or 20 (ARM). XENMEM_decrease_reservation enforced only the latter, higher limit uniformly on all kinds of guests.\n\nAll of these operations involve loops over individual pages (possibly nested, with only the iteration count of the innermost loop being of interest here), resulting in iteration counts of up to 1 million on ARM. Total execution time of these operations obviously depends on system speed, but have been measured to get into the seconds range.\n\nA malicious guest administrator can cause a denial of service. Specifically, prevent use of a physical CPU for a significant period. Other attacks, namely privilege escalation, cannot be ruled out.\n\nIf a host watchdog (Xen or dom0) is in use, this can lead to a watchdog timeout and consequently a reboot of the host. If another, innocent, guest, is configured with a watchdog, this issue can lead to a reboot of such a guest.\n\nAll Xen versions supporting ARM are affected.\n\nThe vulnerability can be avoided if the guest kernel is controlled by the host rather than guest administrator, provided that further steps are taken to prevent the guest administrator from loading code into the kernel (e.g. by disabling loadable modules etc) or from using other mechanisms which allow them to run code at kernel privilege. On ARM, controlling the guest's kernel may involve locking down the bootloader.\n\nExposure may be limited by not passing through physical devices to untrusted guests."

Only libxl-based toolstacks which manage multiple domains in the same process (such as `libvirt') are vulnerable. libxl-based toolstacks which manage only a single domain per process and which exit on failure to create a domain (such as `xl') are not vulnerable. Toolstacks not using libxl are not vulnerable to this issue. Only domains configured to use a PV bootloader in the toolstack domain (e.g. pygrub) will expose this issue. Domains configured to use pvgrub (a totally different program) are not vulnerable. x86 HVM domains are not vulnerable. Systems where the kernel and initial ramdisk are provided by the host administrator from files in domain 0 are not vulnerable. Xen versions 4.1.x and later are vulnerable.\n\nAvoiding the use of the PV bootloader mechanisms which run as processes in the toolstack domain (pygrub), either by providing kernels directly from the toolstack domain or using a PV bootloader which runs in guest context (such as pvgrub) will prevent exposure of this issue."

That is, only systems with a `vpmu' setting on the hypervisor command line. Xen versions from 3.3 onwards are affected. Only x86 systems are affected. ARM systems do not currently implement vPMU and are therefore currently unaffected. In Xen versions prior to 4.6 only HVM guests can take advantage of this unsupported functionality. In Xen versions from 4.6 onwards all guest kinds can use this unsupported functionality. Not enabling vPMU support (by omitting the \"vpmu\" hypervisor command line option) will avoid using and exposing the unsupported functionality."

Use of the feature may have unknown effects, ranging from information leaks through Denial of Service to privilege escalation.\n\nOnly systems which enable the VPMU feature are affected. That is, only systems with a `vpmu' setting on the hypervisor command line. Xen versions from 3.3 onwards are affected. Only x86 systems are affected. ARM systems do not currently implement vPMU and are therefore currently unaffected. In Xen versions prior to 4.6 only HVM guests can take advantage of this unsupported functionality. In Xen versions from 4.6 onwards all guest kinds can use this unsupported functionality. Not enabling vPMU support (by omitting the \"vpmu\" hypervisor command line option) will avoid using and exposing the unsupported functionality."

								"thetext": "Certain HYPERVISOR_memory_op subops take page order inputs, with so far insufficient enforcement of limits thereof. In particular, for all of XENMEM_increase_reservation, XENMEM_populate_physmap, and XENMEM_exchange the order was limited to 9 only for guests without physical devices assigned. Guests with assigned devices were allowed up to order 18 (x86) or 20 (ARM). XENMEM_decrease_reservation enforced only the latter, higher limit uniformly on all kinds of guests.\n\nAll of these operations involve loops over individual pages (possibly nested, with only the iteration count of the innermost loop being of interest here), resulting in iteration counts of up to 1 million on ARM. Total execution time of these operations obviously depends on system speed, but have been measured to get into the seconds range.\n\nA malicious guest administrator can cause a denial of service. Specifically, prevent use of a physical CPU for a significant period. Other attacks, namely privilege escalation, cannot be ruled out.\n\nIf a host watchdog (Xen or dom0) is in use, this can lead to a watchdog timeout and consequently a reboot of the host. If another, innocent, guest, is configured with a watchdog, this issue can lead to a reboot of such a guest.\n\nAll Xen versions supporting ARM are affected.\n\nThe vulnerability can be avoided if the guest kernel is controlled by the host rather than guest administrator, provided that further steps are taken to prevent the guest administrator from loading code into the kernel (e.g. by disabling loadable modules etc) or from using other mechanisms which allow them to run code at kernel privilege. On ARM, controlling the guest's kernel may involve locking down the bootloader.\n\nExposure may be limited by not passing through physical devices to untrusted guests."

That lock, however, was either not acquired or already released on all paths leading to the error handling sequence.\n\nA malicious guest administrator may be able to deny service by crashing the host or causing a deadlock.\n\nAll Xen versions from at least 3.2 onwards are vulnerable. Older versions have not been inspected.\n\nThe vulnerability can be avoided if the guest kernel is controlled by the host rather than guest administrator, provided that further steps are taken to prevent the guest administrator from loading code into the kernel (e.g. by disabling loadable modules etc) or from using other mechanisms which allow them to run code at kernel privilege.

Only libxl-based toolstacks which manage multiple domains in the same process (such as `libvirt') are vulnerable. libxl-based toolstacks which manage only a single domain per process and which exit on failure to create a domain (such as `xl') are not vulnerable. Toolstacks not using libxl are not vulnerable to this issue. Only domains configured to use a PV bootloader in the toolstack domain (e.g. pygrub) will expose this issue. Domains configured to use pvgrub (a totally different program) are not vulnerable. x86 HVM domains are not vulnerable. Systems where the kernel and initial ramdisk are provided by the host administrator from files in domain 0 are not vulnerable. Xen versions 4.1.x and later are vulnerable.\n\nAvoiding the use of the PV bootloader mechanisms which run as processes in the toolstack domain (pygrub), either by providing kernels directly from the toolstack domain or using a PV bootloader which runs in guest context (such as pvgrub) will prevent exposure of this issue."
