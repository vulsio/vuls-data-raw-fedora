								"thetext": "ISSUE DESCRIPTION\n=================\n\nCallers of libxl can specify that a disk should be read-only to the guest. However, there is no code in libxl to pass this information to qemu-xen (the upstream-based qemu); and indeed there is no way in qemu to make a disk read-only.\n\nThe vulnerability is exploitable only via devices emulated by the device model, not the parallel PV devices for supporting PVHVM. Normally the PVHVM device unplug protocol renders the emulated devices inaccessible early in boot.\n\nIMPACT\n======\n\nMalicious guest administrators or (in some situations) users may be able to write to supposedly read-only disk images.\n\nCDROM devices (that is, devices specified to be presented to the guest as CDROMs, regardless of the nature of the backing storage on the host) are not affected.\n\nVULNERABLE SYSTEMS\n==================\n\nOnly systems using qemu-xen (rather than qemu-xen-traditional) as the device model version are vulnerable.\n\nOnly systems using libxl or libxl-based toolstacks are vulnerable. (This includes xl, and libvirt with the libxl driver.)\n\nAll versions of libxl which support qemu-xen are vulnerable. The affected code was introduced in Xen 4.1.\n\nIf the host and guest together usually support PVHVM, the issue is exploitable only if the malicious guest administrator has control of the guest kernel or guest kernel command line.\n\nMITIGATION\n==========\n\nSwitching to qemu-xen-traditional will avoid this vulnerability. This can be done with device_model_version=\"qemu-xen-traditional\" in the xl configuration file.\n\nUsing stub domain device models (which necessarily involves switching to qemu-xen-traditional) will also avoid this vulnerability. This can be done with device_model_stubdomain_override=true in the xl configuration file.\n\nEither of these mitigations is liable to have other guest-visible effects or even regressions.\n\nIt may be possible, depending on the configuration, to make the underlying storage object readonly, or to make it reject writes.\n\nUpstream patches:\n\nhttp://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/xsa142-4.5.patch\nhttp://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/xsa142-4.6.patch\n\n\nExternal References:\n\nhttp://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-142.html\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the Xen project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Michael Young of Durham University as the original reporter."

The bug is fixed in version xen-4.6.1-5.fc24, I confused the error message when editing a file in the read-only disk and thought this file could be edited. And I checked the source rpm the patch ([XSA-142, CVE-2015-7311] (#1257893)) for this bug isn't included in SOURCES, so I thought this fix in xen-4.5.1-8  was missing in the new version xen-4.6.1. Today I retest this bug, the read-only disk cannot be able to write actually. I will close this bug then.\n\nAnd I have a question, for this bug, the upstream xen-4.6.1 has fixed this, so the fedora patch XSA-142 wasn't included in xen-4.6.1-5.fc24, am I right?\nMy question is, could you please tell me the detailed fedora xen build process? Such as, when upstream release a new version, you will compare the fedora patches with the upstream source, if the fedora patches are included in the source, the patches will be dropped, or the left fedora patches are all introduced to the fedora xen new version, is my guess right? Since I checked the xen-4.6.1-5.fc24 changelog, there are many bug fix patches, but in the SPEC and SOURCES, can only find few patches. I guess the others patches were already included in upstream xen-4.6.1.\n\nThank you!\n\nBr,\nLin liu"
