Our IPA servers are on virutal guests, where it is suggested that you explicitly do not run NTP services.  As a result, all our IPA clients sync to various hardware NTP servers around the network (still trying to get funding to get a proper GPS/radio synched clock on the network).\n\nAs I'm explicitly opting out of time synching with the IPA servers, I was just unsure that messages such as the above during installation were a good idea.  By all estimates, my IPA clients and IPA servers should be synching to the same NTP servers at each point on the network, so I don't want any secondary time synching done.  If the client time is outwith the Kerberos tollerance with the IPA server, it's my fault and something that needs fixing by me."

It grew a bit organically and not always in the clearest way.\n\nFor example, if you say --no-ntp chances are you have a local NTP configuration you'd like to preserve. In this case, you suggest, we should check to see if there are any peers and if so, go ahead and try to sync the time. No peers == no sync attempt. And currently we pass in the IPA server to the NTP sync regardless of the current NTP configuration, that is not right in this case either.\n\nI'm a little reluctant to add another option, --no-ntp-sync, or something. Too many knobs can be a bad thing as they atrophy over time if not used."

That part was tagged on the end of the initial text without much thought.\n\nThere'd be an argument to say that if I'm using --no-ntp, I know what I'm doing and you don't need to check.  Don't look at my NTP peers, don't attempt a time sync.\n\nIf, on the other hand, it's relatively simple to look up the NTP peers, check that at least one of them is synched as the time source, then fine.\n\nAgree about not creating too many options."

NTP\nIf a server is being installed on a virtual machine, that server should not run an NTP server. To disable NTP for FreeIPA, use the --no-ntp option. \n\nI followed this advice and thus run _NO_ NTP server on the IPA-server _at all_!\n\n\nSo if I run:\n\"ipa-client-install --no-ntp --ntp-server=ntp.example.com --server=ipa.example.com\"\n\nThen I STILL have to wait for a timeout while ipa-client-install tries to sync the time against ipa.example.com, while I KNOW that everything except syncing against ntp.example.com will fail on my network!\n\nAlso, as ipa-client-install will not touch the default NTP-client (chrony), this means that every default Fedora installation working against a default virtual FreeIPA-server will have to wait for a timeout. And there is no way around it, even if you try to force it to use a server that actually answers on the correct port.\n\n[1]\nhttp://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/17/html/FreeIPA_Guide/installing-ipa.html#prerequisites"

But after the installation, if we want to change this under IPA Server --> ID Ranges --> EXAMPLE.COM_id_range, the change is accepted but it appears that its not getting honored. \n\n\nVersion-Release number of selected component (if applicable): 4.1.20\n\n\nHow reproducible: On a fresh FC21 install.\n\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Install the freeipa-server using yum on a FC21. \n2. Setup IPA using ipa-server-install command. Do not specify an ID range.\n3. Login to the webUI and note the ID range \n5. Change the ID Range.\n5. Create a user or a group. \n\nActual results:\n1. User or group gets an ID from range noted in step #3 above.\n\nExpected results:\n1. User or group should have an ID from range defined in step #4 above.\n\nAdditional info:\nFor adding 1 or 2 users by hand this is just a inconvenience as the ID can be changed after adding the user to whatever we want. But if I'm automating and adding 100s of users/groups it becomes a hassle."
