Please note that\n> relying on transitive dependency (gcc pulls in glibc-headers) is as wrong as\n> relying already gone minimal build root package list.\n\nYou are not relying on any transitive dependency. The compiler, runtime, and headers form an \"implementation\" which is maintained by the Fedora platform tools team (RHEL BaseOS Platform Tools team). We guarantee that \"BuildRequires: gcc\" will give you exactly what you need to build conforming standard C applications.\n\nThe C library and it's headers are not a stand-alone thing like other packages, they are a special part of a coordinated implementation of a language.\n\n> And what if I need headers because I use cpp only to expand them. Which\n> package should I require?\n\nIs there such a use case? Is there such a package? We can certainly discuss this use case if it exists.\n\nThe problem with such a use case is that glibc-headers is *incomplete* without the compiler headers provided by gcc which are also a required part of the runtime. Therefore if you have this use case today you must require gcc or gcc-c++ to get all of the headers you need.\n\n> I think better approach would be first create stable standard library header\n> RPM Provides symbol, then migrate the packages to require it, and then\n> shuffle the header files wherever you want.\n\nThe bugs I have filed are for packages that don't even need glibc-headers, the BuildRequires has been copied from other spec files without consideration for what is needed. The majority of the 24 packages that require glibc-headers really need to BuildRequires on gcc or gcc-c++.\n\nThere is no immediate need for a stable standard library header RPM provides symbol, but I'm open to discussion if there is a package that needs such a requirement."

A devel package that uses standard's conforming headers need not run-require anything. The final user of the devel package will need a standards conforming compiler to compile the code, and that will bring in the required headers.\n\nHopefully the FPC request is approved and the text there clarifies what packagers should list in their BuildRequires or Requires."

If you would still like \nto see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version \nof Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora \nversion prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.\n\nAlthough we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's \nlifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events.

Please note that\n> relying on transitive dependency (gcc pulls in glibc-headers) is as wrong as\n> relying already gone minimal build root package list.\n\nYou are not relying on any transitive dependency. The compiler, runtime, and headers form an \"implementation\" which is maintained by the Fedora platform tools team (RHEL BaseOS Platform Tools team). We guarantee that \"BuildRequires: gcc\" will give you exactly what you need to build conforming standard C applications.\n\nThe C library and it's headers are not a stand-alone thing like other packages, they are a special part of a coordinated implementation of a language.\n\n> And what if I need headers because I use cpp only to expand them. Which\n> package should I require?\n\nIs there such a use case? Is there such a package? We can certainly discuss this use case if it exists.\n\nThe problem with such a use case is that glibc-headers is *incomplete* without the compiler headers provided by gcc which are also a required part of the runtime. Therefore if you have this use case today you must require gcc or gcc-c++ to get all of the headers you need.\n\n> I think better approach would be first create stable standard library header\n> RPM Provides symbol, then migrate the packages to require it, and then\n> shuffle the header files wherever you want.\n\nThe bugs I have filed are for packages that don't even need glibc-headers, the BuildRequires has been copied from other spec files without consideration for what is needed. The majority of the 24 packages that require glibc-headers really need to BuildRequires on gcc or gcc-c++.\n\nThere is no immediate need for a stable standard library header RPM provides symbol, but I'm open to discussion if there is a package that needs such a requirement."

A devel package that uses standard's conforming headers need not run-require anything. The final user of the devel package will need a standards conforming compiler to compile the code, and that will bring in the required headers.\n\nHopefully the FPC request is approved and the text there clarifies what packagers should list in their BuildRequires or Requires."
