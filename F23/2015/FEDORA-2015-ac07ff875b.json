Let's just build against the existing pyOpenSSL and see what breaks (or even if it just works!) ...\n\nIf it doesn't work with the version in base we'll need to look at the letsencrypt code and work out a way of accomplishing the same thing against the version in the repos.\n\nOnce that's sorted we can initially carry a maintainer patch to get this going and submit a pull request upstream. SO far my interaction with upstream has been positive so I don't expect to see much difficulty in such a patch lowering the pyOpenSSL requirements as being troublesome to push back up.\n\n\n> \n> In addition, python-six is needed from RHEL 7.2 which currently requires\n> CentOS's CR repository.\n> \n\nThe main release is any day now, certainly before we get this out so it's not a problem.\n\n> I would like to see the security issue in python-cryptography in RHEL fixed\n> before we start using letencrypt with that, bug 1267548.\n\nHave you verified the actual issue still exists in the version released in RHEL? Since it's a base package now they tend to backport and fix up things like that there ... worth grabbing the changelog from the equivalent centos package and taking a look."

However, when Python is run with -O these asserts are optimized away. If a user ran Python with this flag and got an invalid response code this could result in undefined behavior or worse. Accordingly, all response checks from the OpenSSL backend have been converted from assert to a true function call.\n\nThis issue has been fixed in the 1.0.2 version of python-cryptography.\n\nUpstream changelog:\n\nhttps://cryptography.io/en/stable/changelog/#id1\n\nRelated commits:\n\nhttps://github.com/pyca/cryptography/commit/e3675af0f42e1f3117b61984805c192c1937a64f\nhttps://github.com/pyca/cryptography/commit/3c39eba249bfd4582cfb4f169d7c47492b5369e3\nhttps://github.com/pyca/cryptography/commit/7712edc5fa2bc5244221c35cf97e1b58f5981446\nhttps://github.com/pyca/cryptography/commit/2917e460993c475c72d7146c50dc3bbc2414280d\nhttps://github.com/pyca/cryptography/commit/915e0a1194400203b0e49e05de5facbc4ac8eb66\nhttps://github.com/pyca/cryptography/commit/5fed07c15c696d8c82ef04b4a0e8435b444f4f17"

Accordingly, all response checks from the OpenSSL backend have been converted from assert to a true function call.\n\nThis issue has been fixed in the 1.0.2 version of python-cryptography.\n\nUpstream changelog:\n\nhttps://cryptography.io/en/stable/changelog/#id1\n\nRelated commits:\n\nhttps://github.com/pyca/cryptography/commit/e3675af0f42e1f3117b61984805c192c1937a64f\nhttps://github.com/pyca/cryptography/commit/3c39eba249bfd4582cfb4f169d7c47492b5369e3\nhttps://github.com/pyca/cryptography/commit/7712edc5fa2bc5244221c35cf97e1b58f5981446\nhttps://github.com/pyca/cryptography/commit/2917e460993c475c72d7146c50dc3bbc2414280d\nhttps://github.com/pyca/cryptography/commit/915e0a1194400203b0e49e05de5facbc4ac8eb66\nhttps://github.com/pyca/cryptography/commit/5fed07c15c696d8c82ef04b4a0e8435b444f4f17"
