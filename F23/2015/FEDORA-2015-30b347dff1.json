						"thetext": "Description of problem:\n\nWhen rebooting a Fedora 21 host, the libvirt-guests.sh script can reach the default 90 second timeout and be terminated by systemd before all guests have finished suspending.  When the host restarts, any remaining guests have effectively been powered off without a clean shutdown.\n\n\nVersion-Release number of selected component (if applicable):\n\nlibvirt-client 1.2.9.2-1\nsystemd 216-20\n\n\nHow reproducible:\n\n100% with sufficiently long suspend times across guests\n\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Reboot a host with guests requiring >90 seconds to suspend\n2. Observe guests boot instead of resume\n\n\nAdditional info:\n\nThe service timeout appears to be the DefaultTimeoutStopSec value of 90s, as it's not in the unit file, but present for the unit itself:\n\n╶➤ systemctl show libvirt-guests |grep Timeout\nTimeoutStartUSec=0\nTimeoutStopUSec=1min 30s\n\nThis at least suggests systemd is behaving as expected given the configuration, but this timeout is way too short (and at odds with the 300s per guest default timeout for the shutdown case in libvirt-guests.sh either way).\n\nSlightly anonymized logs of this occurring on a host with several large-ish VMs and spinning disks:\n\nFeb 23 21:06:31 kvmhost libvirt-guests.sh[17385]: Running guests on default URI: vm1, vm2, vm3, vm4\nFeb 23 21:06:31 kvmhost libvirt-guests.sh[17385]: Suspending guests on default URI...\nFeb 23 21:06:31 kvmhost libvirt-guests.sh[17385]: Suspending vm1: ...\nFeb 23 21:06:36 kvmhost libvirt-guests.sh[17385]: Suspending vm1: 1.918 GiB\nFeb 23 21:06:41 kvmhost libvirt-guests.sh[17385]: Suspending vm1: 3.248 GiB\nFeb 23 21:06:46 kvmhost libvirt-guests.sh[17385]: Suspending vm1: 3.454 GiB\nFeb 23 21:06:51 kvmhost libvirt-guests.sh[17385]: Suspending vm1: 3.523 GiB\nFeb 23 21:06:56 kvmhost libvirt-guests.sh[17385]: Suspending vm1: 3.631 GiB\nFeb 23 21:07:01 kvmhost libvirt-guests.sh[17385]: Suspending vm1: 3.743 GiB\nFeb 23 21:07:52 kvmhost libvirt-guests.sh[17385]: Suspending vm1: ...\nFeb 23 21:07:53 kvmhost libvirt-guests.sh[17385]: Suspending vm1: done\nFeb 23 21:07:53 kvmhost libvirt-guests.sh[17385]: Suspending vm2: ...\nFeb 23 21:07:58 kvmhost libvirt-guests.sh[17385]: Suspending vm2: 1.998 GiB\nFeb 23 21:08:00 kvmhost systemd[1]: libvirt-guests.service stopping timed out.
