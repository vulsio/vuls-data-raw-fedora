That is, only systems with an `allowsuperpage' setting on the hypervisor command line. Note that in Xen 4.0.x and 3.4.x the option is named `allowhugepage'. Xen versions 3.4.0, 3.4.1, and from 4.1 onwards are affected. Only x86 systems are affected. Only PV guests can exploit the vulnerability.\n\nRunning only HVM guests will avoid this issue. Not enabling PV superpage support (by omitting the `allowsuperpage' or `allowhugepage' hypervisor command line options) will avoid exposing the issue."
