I haven't tried it out for real, but the reported failure when I run \"make test\" looks like it does the right thing.\n\nWhat the code did before I intervened is to take the whole header value (i.e. everything after the first colon) and encode it in its entirety as UTF-8 quoted printable.  What I did instead is to take that complete value, split it on white space, and for each chunk check whether it is pure ASCII (range ! to ~) and if so, pass it unchanged.  Otherwise use the old code to encode the piece.  Then at the end, join all the pieces (encoded and unchanged) with a space between them.\n\nA proper Perl programmer might want to take a look whether this is any good.\n\nThe code is based on the patched source from perl-Encode-2.80-4.fc23.src.rpm (i.e., I ran rpmbuild -bp)."

ASCI SPACE QUOTED sequence and QUOTED SPACE QUOTED sequence has different rules for ignoring the SPACE in between.\n\nThe Encode::MIME::Header was broken because of this and the 2.83 fixed it finally. The resolution is that Encode::MIME::Header will always encode whole header value as one chunk. If an application wants to encode headers with e-mail addresses (e.g. To:), it must do the segmentation by itself and pass for encoding only the interested parts. See <https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=111853> and a fix for a broken Encode::MIME::Header user <https://github.com/theory/svn-notify/pull/15>.\n\nI don't know yet what to do in Fedora 23. Maybe I will applyr you patch to restore older behavior in the expense that the encoding will be broken in some cases.\n\nBut Fedora >= 24 will include the 2.83 version that does not do the segmentation and the one who must be fixed there will be the applications.\n\nI'm sorry upgrading the perl-Encode in Fedora 23 caused problems to you, I will try to restore the old behavior thankfully to your patch.\n\nPlease talk to Encode developers in <https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=111853>. They are experts in this area and I believe they can explain the Encode design better than me and can help you with developing the best fix for you applications."

This is because splitting the text into multiple lines happens before calling _encode_q(). The line splitting code expects all the lines will start and end with encoded-word (=?...?=) so the line break will be ignored when decoding.\n\nBut in this case you have a plain line followed by an encoded line, and in this case the line break is decoded as a space.\n\nI feel it's not possible to fix Encode-2.80 to restore original behavior without introducing bugs.\n\nIf your Bugzilla installation comes from Fedora's package, please file a bug against bugzilla component to fix how Bugzilla uses Encode::encode('MIME-Q')."

I thought putting the bug back to the ASSIGNED status would prevent bodhi from touching it again but it looks like I was wrong.\n\nOkay, given the lack of activity of bmo's bug #1246228, I've decided to include Frédéric's submitted patch.
