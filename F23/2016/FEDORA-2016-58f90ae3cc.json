						"thetext": "All MySQL and MariaDB packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Red Hat Software Collections install my.cnf configuration file as root-owned and not writeable to the mysql user under which mysqld is run.  The configuration file is created in /etc and not inside the data directory.\n\nAll MySQL and MariaDB packages in at least Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and later, and Red Hat Software Collections allow database users with FILE privileges to create my.cnf file inside data directory that is not world-writeable, and hence is not ignored by mysqld / mysqld_safe.\n\nAll MySQL and MariaDB packages for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 (either directly from Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 or from Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7) run mysqld_safe with mysql user privileges and not root privileges.  Therefore, the worst impact of this issue on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 is escalation form database user with FILE privileges to arbitrary code execution as mysql system user.  Additionally, the init script / systemd unit for rh-mariadb101 collection for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 does not use mysqld_safe at all and is therefore not vulnerable to the published exploit.\n\nThe MySQL 5.1 packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 include the version of mysqld_safe that does not implement support for library preloading.  Therefore, the published remote exploit does not affect those packages.  Note that there is still a possibility of local privilege escalation - a database user with FILE privileges that also has local unprivileged shell access can escalate their privileges to root.\n\nFor certain MySQL / MariaDB packages running on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, the issue is further mitigated by SELinux, which prevents loading of the injected shared library.\n\nMitigating factors:\n\n- The attack can only be performed by an attacker with database access with FILE privileges.  The FILE privilege is not commonly granted to non-administrative database users, and as noted in the reporter's advisory, it allows gaining full administrative privileges (unless restricted with the secure_file_priv setting).  As noted in the advisory, SQL injection flaws in web applications may open up this issue to attackers who are not meant to have direct database access.  Ensure that the FILE privilege is not granted to any non-administrative database user.  Note that reporter claims existence of another, not yet disclosed vulnerability which makes exploitation of this issue possible without FILE privilege.  The CVE-2016-6663 was reserved for the additional vulnerability.\n\n- Published exploit depends on an already existing my.cnf that is writeable to the mysql user.  As noted above, in the default configuration of MySQL/MariaDB packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Red Hat Software Collections, the configuration file is not writeable to the mysql user.  While the advisory describes how to create a new my.cnf in the data directory that is read by mysqld / mysqld_safe, the newly created file is rejected as malformed as it does not start with a valid INI file section delimiter.  The advisory does not mention any way to avoid this exploitation obstacle.\n\nThe combination of the above two factors imply that the published exploit does not work against the default configuration of MySQL and MariaDB in Red Hat products."

Additionally, MySQL 5.0 does not support general_log, which is also required by this exploit.

Instead, use the\n  --general_log option to enable the general query log and the\n  --general_log_file=file_name option to set the general query log file name.\n  The values of these options are available in the general_log and\n  general_log_file system variables, which can be changed at runtime.\n\n  http://downloads.mysql.com/docs/mysql-5.1-relnotes-en.pdf\n\nAs hinted by the above, --log could not be changed at runtime."

The most notable changes include:\n\n* The list of affected MySQL versions was updated to note that the issue was fixed in versions 5.5.52, 5.6.33, and 5.7.15, as noted in comment 5 above.\n\n* Author now more explicitly claims that even though published exploit requires existing my.cnf file that is writeable to the mysql system user, there is a different exploit that has not been published yet, which does not require existing my.cnf with weak permissions.\n\nAdvisory explains that it is possible to create new my.cnf file in the data directory, which has to be writeable to the mysql user.  Such file does not typically exist.  When created using the general_log mechanism used by the exploit, it will not start with INI file [section] label, causing it to be rejected by MySQL as invalid and its content ignored.  It is unclear if a mechanism used to create a well-formed my.cnf using MySQL logging would be classified as a separate vulnerability.\n\nThe advisory includes the following mitigation instructions:\n\n  As temporary mitigations, users should ensure that no mysql config files\n  are owned by mysql user, and create root-owned dummy my.cnf files that\n  are not in use.\n  These are by no means a complete solution and users should apply official\n  vendor patches as soon as they become available.\n\nIt is unclear why this contradicting information is given, and if the private exploit can work if root-owned my.cnf exist in the data directory."

Depending on the build, it's either NULL (preventing use of FILE privilege), or an empty dedicated directory that is created by Oracle distributed binary packages.  Additionally, mysqld now tries to detect insecure secure_file_priv setting at startup and refuse to start if it's insecure.

Additionally, the init script / systemd unit for rh-mariadb101 collection for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 does not use mysqld_safe at all and is therefore not vulnerable to the published exploit.\n\nThe MySQL 5.1 packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 include the version of mysqld_safe that does not implement support for library preloading.  Therefore, the published remote exploit does not affect those packages.  Note that there is still a possibility of local privilege escalation - a database user with FILE privileges that also has local unprivileged shell access can escalate their privileges to root.\n\nFor certain MySQL / MariaDB packages running on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, the issue is further mitigated by SELinux, which prevents loading of the injected shared library.\n\nMitigating factors:\n\n- The attack can only be performed by an attacker with database access with FILE privileges.  The FILE privilege is not commonly granted to non-administrative database users, and as noted in the reporter's advisory, it allows gaining full administrative privileges (unless restricted with the secure_file_priv setting).  As noted in the advisory, SQL injection flaws in web applications may open up this issue to attackers who are not meant to have direct database access.  Ensure that the FILE privilege is not granted to any non-administrative database user.  Note that reporter claims existence of another, not yet disclosed vulnerability which makes exploitation of this issue possible without FILE privilege.  The CVE-2016-6663 was reserved for the additional vulnerability.\n\n- Published exploit depends on an already existing my.cnf that is writeable to the mysql user.  As noted above, in the default configuration of MySQL/MariaDB packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Red Hat Software Collections, the configuration file is not writeable to the mysql user.  While the advisory describes how to create a new my.cnf in the data directory that is read by mysqld / mysqld_safe, the newly created file is rejected as malformed as it does not start with a valid INI file section delimiter.  The advisory does not mention any way to avoid this exploitation obstacle.\n\nThe combination of the above two factors imply that the published exploit does not work against the default configuration of MySQL and MariaDB in Red Hat products."

Have you figured out how they were able to do so, as that's likely an issue of its own?

Comments above note that DB user with sufficient privileges can create new my.cnf file inside of the data directory.  That file is read by mysqld, and as it's not valid INI file, it leads to the service restart failure as you describe."

Such file does not typically exist.  When created using the general_log mechanism used by the exploit, it will not start with INI file [section] label, causing it to be rejected by MySQL as invalid and its content ignored.  It is unclear if a mechanism used to create a well-formed my.cnf using MySQL logging would be classified as a separate vulnerability.\n\nThe advisory includes the following mitigation instructions:\n\n  As temporary mitigations, users should ensure that no mysql config files\n  are owned by mysql user, and create root-owned dummy my.cnf files that\n  are not in use.\n  These are by no means a complete solution and users should apply official\n  vendor patches as soon as they become available.\n\nIt is unclear why this contradicting information is given, and if the private exploit can work if root-owned my.cnf exist in the data directory."

This is the default configuration in Red Hat products.\n> \nBased on new fix, Even if they are writeable by mysql user (per file permissions), general query log and slow query log can no longer be written to a file ending with .ini or .cnf\n\n> - Ensure that non-administrative database users are not granted FILE\n> privilege. Applications accessing data in MySQL / MariaDB databases,\n> including web application potentially vulnerable to SQL injections, should\n> use database accounts with the lowest privileges required.\n> \nBased on new fix, Even if non-admin database users are granted FILE privilege, they won't be able to write into .ini or .cnf files.\n\n> - If FILE permission needs to be granted to some non-administrative database\n> users, use secure_file_priv setting to limit where files can be written to\n> or read from.\n\nAs I understand, the fix MySQL versions 5.5.53, 5.6.34, and 5.7.16, mitigates this issue completely and there is no need for any additional mitigations. Am I missing something?"
