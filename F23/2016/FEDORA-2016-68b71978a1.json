In\n64-bit, NULL has a special meaning for user segments, and there is no\nway of preventing access.  However, in both 32-bit and 64-bit, a NULL\nLDT system segment is intended to prevent access.\n\nOn Intel hardware, loading a NULL selector zeros the base as well as most\nattributes, but sets the limit field to its largest possible value.  On AMD\nhardware, loading a NULL selector zeros the attributes, leaving the stale base\nand limit intact.\n\nXen may erroneously permit the access using unexpected base/limit values.\n\nAbility to exploit this vulnerability on Intel is easy, but on AMD depends in\na complicated way on how the guest kernel manages LDTs.\n\nIMPACT\n======\n\nAn unprivileged guest user program may be able to elevate its privilege\nto that of the guest operating system.\n\nVULNERABLE SYSTEMS\n==================\n\nThe vulnerability is only exposed to HVM guests.\n\nARM systems are NOT vulnerable.\n\nAll versions of Xen are affected.\n\nHowever, we believe that the vulnerability cannot be exploited on Xen\n4.7 by completely unprivileged guest processes, unless the VM has been\nexplicitly configured with a non-default cpu vendor string (in xm/xl,\nthis would be done with a `cpuid=' domain config option).\n\nMITIGATION\n==========\n\nRunning only PV guests will avoid this issue.\n\nExternal References:\n\nhttp://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-191.html\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nName: the Xen project\nUpstream: Andrew Cooper (Citrix)"

Xen will\nthen read the wrong part of the IDT and interpret it in an unintended\nmanner.\n\nWhen Xen emulates instructions which generate software interrupts, and\nchooses to deliver the software interrupt, it may try to use the\nmethod intended for injecting exceptions.  This is incorrect, and\nresults in a guest crash.\n\nThese instructions are not ususally handled by the emulator.\nExploiting the bug requires ability to force use of the emulator.\n\nIMPACT\n======\n\nAn unprivileged guest user program may be able to crash the guest.\n\nVULNERABLE SYSTEMS\n==================\n\nXen versions 4.5 and newer are vulnerable.

						"thetext": "ISSUE DESCRIPTION\n=================\n\npygrub, the boot loader emulator, fails to quote (or sanity check) its\nresults when reporting them to its caller.\n\npygrub supports a number of output formats.  When the S-expression\noutput format is requested, putting string quotes and S-expressions in\nthe bootloader configuration file can produce incorrect output.\n\nWhen the nul-delimited output format is requested, nul bytes in the\nbootloader configuration file can produce an ambiguous or confusing\noutput file, which is interpreted by libxl in a vulnerable way.\n\nThe existing bootloader config interpreters all read input in a\nline-based way from their bootloaders, and none of them support any\nkind of escaping.  So the newline-delimited output format is safe.\n\nThe attacker can use this to cause the toolstack to treat any file\naccessible to the toolstack as if it were the guest's initial ramdisk\nfile.  The file contents are provided to the guest kernel; also,\nnormally, these files are deleted by the toolstack as the guest starts\nto boot; alternatively they may be deleted later.\n\nIMPACT\n======\n\nA malicious guest administrator can obtain the contents of sensitive\nhost files (an information leak).\n\nAdditionally, a malicious guest administrator can cause files on the\nhost to be removed, causing a denial of service.  In some unusual host\nconfigurations, ability to remove certain files may be useable for\nprivilege escalation.\n\n\nVULNERABLE SYSTEMS\n==================\n\nXen versions 2.0 and later are vulnerable.\n\nThe vulnerability is only exposed to guests configured by the host\nadministrator to boot using pygrub.  In the xl and xm domain\nconfiguration file, this is typically achieved with\nbootloader=\"pygrub\"\nOn x86 this would typically apply only to PV domains.\n\nAll systems using xl, libxl, or libvirt are vulnerable to pygrub-using\nguests.\n\nSystems using other (third-party) toolstacks may or may not be\nvulnerable, depending on whether pygrub is configured, and what pygrub\noutput format they use.  Please consult your toolstack provider.\n\n\nMITIGATION\n==========\n\nConfiguring guests not to use pygrub will avoid the vulnerability.\n\nFor x86 PV guests currently using pygrub, booting the guest as HVM\nis often a practical option to avoid pygrub.\n\n\nExternal References:\n\nhttp://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-198.html\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nName: the Xen project\nUpstream: Daniel Richman (the Cambridge University Student-Run Computing Facility), Gábor Szarka (the Cambridge University Student-Run Computing Facility)"

We are\nnot aware of any such operating systems.\n\nThe vulnerability is NOT exposed on any PV guests.\nThe vulnerability is NOT exposed on any 64-bit guests,\n\nARM systems are NOT vulnerable.\n\nXen versions from 4.0 onwards are affected.  Xen versions 3.4 and\nearlier are not affected.\n\nMITIGATION\n==========\n\nFor guests which are affected, the vulnerability could possibly be\nmitigated by disabling access to VM86 mode by unprivileged guest\nprograms.  Details would depend on the (so far hypothetical)\nvulnerable guest kernel.\n\nExternal References:\n\nhttp://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-192.html\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nName: the Xen project\nUpstream: Jan Beulich (SUSE)"

This\ncheck is sometimes erroneously conducted as if the IDT had the format\nfor a 32-bit guest, when in fact it is in the 64-bit format.  Xen will\nthen read the wrong part of the IDT and interpret it in an unintended\nmanner.\n\nWhen Xen emulates instructions which generate software interrupts, and\nchooses to deliver the software interrupt, it may try to use the\nmethod intended for injecting exceptions.  This is incorrect, and\nresults in a guest crash.\n\nThese instructions are not ususally handled by the emulator.\nExploiting the bug requires ability to force use of the emulator.\n\nIMPACT\n======\n\nAn unprivileged guest user program may be able to crash the guest.\n\nVULNERABLE SYSTEMS\n==================\n\nXen versions 4.5 and newer are vulnerable.  Older versions are not\nvulnerable.\n\nThe vulnerability is only exposed on AMD hardware lacking the NRip\nfeature.

								"thetext": "ISSUE DESCRIPTION\n=================\n\npygrub, the boot loader emulator, fails to quote (or sanity check) its\nresults when reporting them to its caller.\n\npygrub supports a number of output formats.  When the S-expression\noutput format is requested, putting string quotes and S-expressions in\nthe bootloader configuration file can produce incorrect output.\n\nWhen the nul-delimited output format is requested, nul bytes in the\nbootloader configuration file can produce an ambiguous or confusing\noutput file, which is interpreted by libxl in a vulnerable way.\n\nThe existing bootloader config interpreters all read input in a\nline-based way from their bootloaders, and none of them support any\nkind of escaping.  So the newline-delimited output format is safe.\n\nThe attacker can use this to cause the toolstack to treat any file\naccessible to the toolstack as if it were the guest's initial ramdisk\nfile.  The file contents are provided to the guest kernel; also,\nnormally, these files are deleted by the toolstack as the guest starts\nto boot; alternatively they may be deleted later.\n\nIMPACT\n======\n\nA malicious guest administrator can obtain the contents of sensitive\nhost files (an information leak).\n\nAdditionally, a malicious guest administrator can cause files on the\nhost to be removed, causing a denial of service.  In some unusual host\nconfigurations, ability to remove certain files may be useable for\nprivilege escalation.\n\n\nVULNERABLE SYSTEMS\n==================\n\nXen versions 2.0 and later are vulnerable.\n\nThe vulnerability is only exposed to guests configured by the host\nadministrator to boot using pygrub.  In the xl and xm domain\nconfiguration file, this is typically achieved with\nbootloader=\"pygrub\"\nOn x86 this would typically apply only to PV domains.\n\nAll systems using xl, libxl, or libvirt are vulnerable to pygrub-using\nguests.\n\nSystems using other (third-party) toolstacks may or may not be\nvulnerable, depending on whether pygrub is configured, and what pygrub\noutput format they use.  Please consult your toolstack provider.\n\n\nMITIGATION\n==========\n\nConfiguring guests not to use pygrub will avoid the vulnerability.\n\nFor x86 PV guests currently using pygrub, booting the guest as HVM\nis often a practical option to avoid pygrub.\n\n\nExternal References:\n\nhttp://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-198.html\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nName: the Xen project\nUpstream: Daniel Richman (the Cambridge University Student-Run Computing Facility), Gábor Szarka (the Cambridge University Student-Run Computing Facility)"
