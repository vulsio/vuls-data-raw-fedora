(Without DT_BIND_NOW, gpgme:fork@got.plt would be lazily resolve after libpthread:__libc_fork@got is correctly relocated.)\n\n\nThis does not crash on F22 with\n> glibc-2.21-13.fc22.x86_64\n> gpgme-1.4.3-5.fc22.x86_64\nOne reason is that gpgme is not compiled with DT_BIND_NOW in this version, but apparently the primary difference is glibc: with a stub gpgme replacement (attached):\n> gcc -shared -Wl,-z,now -Wall -Wextra -fPIC -o libmyso.so myso.c\n> gcc -Wall -Wextra -O2 foo.c -lpthread ./libmyso.so \n> ./a.out\ncrashes on F23, but not on F22.\n\n\nAFAICS there is no official documentation to suggest that adding -lpthread is unsupported: (info gcc) only documents -pthread; in fact c99(1P) explicitly documents “-l pthread” as the portable way to"

Without the looping behavior, the alloca should be harmless for pretty much all applications because the size argument depends on the size of the generated (outgoing) UDP packet and will be well below default stack sizes. Therefore it is not affected by this flaw.\n\nOn Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7: Looping behaviour was observed and segfaults with small stack sizes. -fstack-class-protection will turn this into a reliable crash (no code execution possible).
