The first is in jas_image_cmpt_create() function in src/libjasper/base/jas_image.c which contains this code:\n\n 310     long size;\n ...\n 328     size = cmpt->width_ * cmpt->height_ * cmpt->cps_;\n 329     cmpt->stream_ = (inmem) ? jas_stream_memopen(0, size) : jas_stream_tmpfile();\n\nComputed size here can be 2^31 or more.  That's a problem for jas_stream_memopen().  Type of its second argument - bufsize - is int, so the function can see negative bufsize.  That's indication that a buffer that can be automatically grown later is to be allocated.  From src/libjasper/base/jas_stream.c:\n\n 171 jas_stream_t *jas_stream_memopen(char *buf, int bufsize)\n 172 {\n ...\n 203     /* If the buffer size specified is nonpositive, then the buffer\n 204     is allocated internally and automatically grown as needed. */\n 205     if (bufsize <= 0) {\n 206         obj->bufsize_ = 1024;\n 207         obj->growable_ = 1;\n 208     } else {\n 209         obj->bufsize_ = bufsize;\n 210         obj->growable_ = 0;\n 211     }\n 212     if (buf) {\n 213         obj->buf_ = (unsigned char *) buf;\n 214     } else {\n 215         obj->buf_ = jas_malloc(obj->bufsize_);\n 216         obj->myalloc_ = 1;\n 217     }\n\nBack in jas_image_cmpt_create(), the following code is called subsequently:\n\n 335     /* Zero the component data.  This isn't necessary, but it is\n 336     convenient for debugging purposes. */\n 337     if (jas_stream_seek(cmpt->stream_, size - 1, SEEK_SET) < 0 ||\n 338       jas_stream_putc(cmpt->stream_, 0) == EOF ||\n 339       jas_stream_seek(cmpt->stream_, 0, SEEK_SET) < 0) {\n\nThere, jas_stream_flushbuf() is called which further leads to call to mem_write().

As seen above, initial bufsize_ is initially set to 1024 and doubled with every iteration of the while loop.  As newpos > 2^31, computed newbufsize is 2^32, which is passed to mem_resize().  The mem_resize() is wrapper around jas_realloc(), but its bufsize argument is int:\n\n 990 static int mem_resize(jas_stream_memobj_t *m, int bufsize)\n ...\n 995     if (!(buf = jas_realloc(m->buf_, bufsize))) {\n\nThis leads to jas_realloc() / realloc() called with the size of 0, which frees the buffer instead of increasing its size.  Subsequently called mem_close() (called via jas_image_cmpt_destroy() and jas_stream_close()) double frees the buffer.\n\nThe above notes are for 64bit systems where sizeof(long) > sizeof(int)."

The first is in jas_image_cmpt_create()\n> function in src/libjasper/base/jas_image.c which contains this code:\n> \n>  310     long size;\n>  ...\n>  328     size = cmpt->width_ * cmpt->height_ * cmpt->cps_;\n>  329     cmpt->stream_ = (inmem) ? jas_stream_memopen(0, size) :\n> jas_stream_tmpfile();\n> \n> Computed size here can be 2^31 or more.\n\nThere was an attempt to fix this in version 1.900.8 by adding integer overflow checks to the jas_image_cmpt_create() function:\n\nhttps://github.com/mdadams/jasper/commit/b35a05635e56f554870ce85f64293a3868793f69\n\n  if (!jas_safe_size_mul(cmpt->width_, cmpt->height_, &size) ||\n    !jas_safe_size_mul(size, cmpt->cps_, &size)) {\n  \tgoto error;\n  }\n\nThis only ensures that the result of multiplication can fit into size_t without overflowing.  However, as size is passed to jas_stream_memopen(), which uses int type for its second argument bufsize, this check does not prevent the jas_stream_memopen() function from being called with negative bufsize as a result of the size_t -> int type conversion.\n\nThe code was further changed in version 1.900.25 to use one call of jas_safe_size_mul3() instead of two calls of jas_safe_size_mul() to implement the overflow check:\n\nhttps://github.com/mdadams/jasper/commit/d42b2388f7f8e0332c846675133acea151fc557a#diff-6cf8c17c2a7595ef1481b68354696c37R379\n\n  if (!jas_safe_size_mul3(cmpt->width_, cmpt->height_, cmpt->cps_, &size)) {\n  \tgoto error;\n  }\n\nThis version of the check has the same problem.\n\nAnother related check was added in version 1.900.25 via this commit:\n\nhttps://github.com/mdadams/jasper/commit/d42b2388f7f8e0332c846675133acea151fc557a#diff-6cf8c17c2a7595ef1481b68354696c37R357\n\n  if (!jas_safe_intfast32_mul3(width, height, depth, 0)) {\n  \tgoto error;\n  }\n\nwhere:\n\n  cmpt->width_ = width;\n  cmpt->height_ = height;\n  cmpt->cps_ = (depth + 7) / 8;\n\nThis check ensures that the multiplication to produce size fits into int_fast32_t.  However, int_fast32_t type is not guaranteed to be exactly 32 bits, it's only guaranteed to be at least 32 bits.  For example on x86_64 it is 64 bit type and hence it does not prevent overflow or truncation in call to jas_stream_memopen().\n\nIt seems the fix for this part of the problem was completed via this commit added in version 1.900.22:\n\nhttps://github.com/mdadams/jasper/commit/634ce8e8a5accc0fa05dd2c20d42b4749d4b2735\n\nIt uses similar approach to what was used by the problematic patch attached in comment 4 and changes types of certain variables from int to size_t.  However, it does not change API of the jas_stream_memopen() function, it rather adds new function jas_stream_memopen2(), which uses size_t type for the bufsize argument.  jas_stream_memopen() is implemented as wrapper around jas_stream_memopen2().  The jas_image_cmpt_create() function was changed to call jas_stream_memopen2(), removing size_t -> int cast.\n\nIf we decide to backport the fix without introducing jas_stream_memopen2(), alternative should be to add overflow check guarding computation of size, and next ensure that size does not exceed INT_MAX before calling jas_stream_memopen().\n\n> At this point, m->pos_ corresponds to the original size from\n> jas_image_cmpt_create().

That's a problem for jas_stream_memopen().  Type of its second argument - bufsize - is int, so the function can see negative bufsize.  That's indication that a buffer that can be automatically grown later is to be allocated.  From src/libjasper/base/jas_stream.c:\n\n 171 jas_stream_t *jas_stream_memopen(char *buf, int bufsize)\n 172 {\n ...\n 203     /* If the buffer size specified is nonpositive, then the buffer\n 204     is allocated internally and automatically grown as needed. */\n 205     if (bufsize <= 0) {\n 206         obj->bufsize_ = 1024;\n 207         obj->growable_ = 1;\n 208     } else {\n 209         obj->bufsize_ = bufsize;\n 210         obj->growable_ = 0;\n 211     }\n 212     if (buf) {\n 213         obj->buf_ = (unsigned char *) buf;\n 214     } else {\n 215         obj->buf_ = jas_malloc(obj->bufsize_);\n 216         obj->myalloc_ = 1;\n 217     }\n\nBack in jas_image_cmpt_create(), the following code is called subsequently:\n\n 335     /* Zero the component data.  This isn't necessary, but it is\n 336     convenient for debugging purposes. */\n 337     if (jas_stream_seek(cmpt->stream_, size - 1, SEEK_SET) < 0 ||\n 338       jas_stream_putc(cmpt->stream_, 0) == EOF ||\n 339       jas_stream_seek(cmpt->stream_, 0, SEEK_SET) < 0) {\n\nThere, jas_stream_flushbuf() is called which further leads to call to mem_write().

As seen above, initial bufsize_ is initially set to 1024 and doubled with every iteration of the while loop.  As newpos > 2^31, computed newbufsize is 2^32, which is passed to mem_resize().  The mem_resize() is wrapper around jas_realloc(), but its bufsize argument is int:\n\n 990 static int mem_resize(jas_stream_memobj_t *m, int bufsize)\n ...\n 995     if (!(buf = jas_realloc(m->buf_, bufsize))) {\n\nThis leads to jas_realloc() / realloc() called with the size of 0, which frees the buffer instead of increasing its size.  Subsequently called mem_close() (called via jas_image_cmpt_destroy() and jas_stream_close()) double frees the buffer.\n\nThe above notes are for 64bit systems where sizeof(long) > sizeof(int)."

The first is in jas_image_cmpt_create()\n> function in src/libjasper/base/jas_image.c which contains this code:\n> \n>  310     long size;\n>  ...\n>  328     size = cmpt->width_ * cmpt->height_ * cmpt->cps_;\n>  329     cmpt->stream_ = (inmem) ? jas_stream_memopen(0, size) :\n> jas_stream_tmpfile();\n> \n> Computed size here can be 2^31 or more.\n\nThere was an attempt to fix this in version 1.900.8 by adding integer overflow checks to the jas_image_cmpt_create() function:\n\nhttps://github.com/mdadams/jasper/commit/b35a05635e56f554870ce85f64293a3868793f69\n\n  if (!jas_safe_size_mul(cmpt->width_, cmpt->height_, &size) ||\n    !jas_safe_size_mul(size, cmpt->cps_, &size)) {\n  \tgoto error;\n  }\n\nThis only ensures that the result of multiplication can fit into size_t without overflowing.  However, as size is passed to jas_stream_memopen(), which uses int type for its second argument bufsize, this check does not prevent the jas_stream_memopen() function from being called with negative bufsize as a result of the size_t -> int type conversion.\n\nThe code was further changed in version 1.900.25 to use one call of jas_safe_size_mul3() instead of two calls of jas_safe_size_mul() to implement the overflow check:\n\nhttps://github.com/mdadams/jasper/commit/d42b2388f7f8e0332c846675133acea151fc557a#diff-6cf8c17c2a7595ef1481b68354696c37R379\n\n  if (!jas_safe_size_mul3(cmpt->width_, cmpt->height_, cmpt->cps_, &size)) {\n  \tgoto error;\n  }\n\nThis version of the check has the same problem.\n\nAnother related check was added in version 1.900.25 via this commit:\n\nhttps://github.com/mdadams/jasper/commit/d42b2388f7f8e0332c846675133acea151fc557a#diff-6cf8c17c2a7595ef1481b68354696c37R357\n\n  if (!jas_safe_intfast32_mul3(width, height, depth, 0)) {\n  \tgoto error;\n  }\n\nwhere:\n\n  cmpt->width_ = width;\n  cmpt->height_ = height;\n  cmpt->cps_ = (depth + 7) / 8;\n\nThis check ensures that the multiplication to produce size fits into int_fast32_t.  However, int_fast32_t type is not guaranteed to be exactly 32 bits, it's only guaranteed to be at least 32 bits.  For example on x86_64 it is 64 bit type and hence it does not prevent overflow or truncation in call to jas_stream_memopen().\n\nIt seems the fix for this part of the problem was completed via this commit added in version 1.900.22:\n\nhttps://github.com/mdadams/jasper/commit/634ce8e8a5accc0fa05dd2c20d42b4749d4b2735\n\nIt uses similar approach to what was used by the problematic patch attached in comment 4 and changes types of certain variables from int to size_t.  However, it does not change API of the jas_stream_memopen() function, it rather adds new function jas_stream_memopen2(), which uses size_t type for the bufsize argument.  jas_stream_memopen() is implemented as wrapper around jas_stream_memopen2().  The jas_image_cmpt_create() function was changed to call jas_stream_memopen2(), removing size_t -> int cast.\n\nIf we decide to backport the fix without introducing jas_stream_memopen2(), alternative should be to add overflow check guarding computation of size, and next ensure that size does not exceed INT_MAX before calling jas_stream_memopen().\n\n> At this point, m->pos_ corresponds to the original size from\n> jas_image_cmpt_create().  As seen above, initial bufsize_ is initially set\n> to 1024 and doubled with every iteration of the while loop.  As newpos >\n> 2^31, computed newbufsize is 2^32, which is passed to mem_resize().  The\n> mem_resize() is wrapper around jas_realloc(), but its bufsize argument is\n> int:\n> \n>  990 static int mem_resize(jas_stream_memobj_t *m, int bufsize)\n>  ...\n>  995     if (!(buf = jas_realloc(m->buf_, bufsize))) {\n> \n> This leads to jas_realloc() / realloc() called with the size of 0, which\n> frees the buffer instead of increasing its size.  Subsequently called\n> mem_close() (called via jas_image_cmpt_destroy() and jas_stream_close())\n> double frees the buffer.\n\nThis double free issue got separate CVE id CVE-2016-8693 and was fixed in version 1.900.10, see bug 1385507."
