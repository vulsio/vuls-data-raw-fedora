So if this requires a reply sooner, then the general secalert@ address has a 24hr SLA to get replies. \n\nThat being said, since the issue was reported to Red Hat, we aim to provide this upfront co-ordination as you described. I /assume/ that yes, Kurt has communicated to the distro list to this date, giving them appropriate time to react. \n\nI'll chase down on my end to see if Kurt can provide additional information, or another member of our team.\n\nRegards,\nCliff"

So if this requires a reply sooner, then the general secalert@ address has a 24hr SLA to get replies. \n\nThat being said, since the issue was reported to Red Hat, we aim to provide this upfront co-ordination as you described. I /assume/ that yes, Kurt has communicated to the distro list to this date, giving them appropriate time to react. \n\nI'll chase down on my end to see if Kurt can provide additional information, or another member of our team.\n\nRegards,\nCliff"

This would result in the library generating numbers using only an 8th the number of random bits than what were intended: 128 or 256 bits instead of 1023 or 2047\n\nUsing such drastically reduced amount of random bits for Diffie Hellman weakened the handshake security significantly.\n\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name CVE-2016-0787 to this issue.\n",
