The version in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 is 0.9.8.  However, it does not contain match_hostname, as it was patched to use implementation from the python-backports-ssl_match_hostname package.  Version 0.9.8 is also used in python-setuptools packages in python27 and python33 collections in Red Hat Software Collections.  Those packages already include a patch for CVE-2013-7440.

However, python-urllib3 and python-requests packages in Red Hat products and Fedora do not bundle backports.ssl_match_hostname and instead use the version in python-backports-ssl_match_hostname packages.\n\n\nThere are several multiple copies of match_hostname implementation in python-pip:\n\n- pip/backwardcompat/ssl_match_hostname.py\n  - this was used in pip version prior to 1.5, removed via:\n    https://github.com/pypa/pip/commit/c61b5df\n  - version included in pip 1.4.1 was affected by CVE-2013-7440, but not\n    affected by CVE-2013-2099 (bug 963260)\n  - version included in pip 1.3.4 is affected by both CVE-2013-7440 and\n    CVE-2013-2099, but some Red Hat packages already include patch for\n    CVE-2013-2099\n\n- pip/_vendor/requests/packages/urllib3/packages/ssl_match_hostname/_implementation.py\n  - embedded requests library with embedded urllib3 with embedded\n    backports.ssl_match_hostname\n  - added in pip 1.5 when requests 2.0.0 was added, using ssl_match_hostname\n    version with this issue already fixed\n    https://github.com/pypa/pip/commit/651a961\n\n- pip/_vendor/distlib/compat.py\n  - code was affected by both CVE-2013-2099 and CVE-2013-7440 until pip 6.0.0,\n    when embedded distlib was updated to version 0.2.0:\n    https://github.com/pypa/pip/commit/320a07f\n  - it's unclear to me if match_hostname copy in distlib is used by pip\n\n\ndistlib is also packaged separately in Fedora.  The current version of python-distlib packages is 0.1.9.  CVE-2013-2099 and CVE-2013-7440 were only fixed upstream in 0.2.0 via:\nhttps://bitbucket.org/vinay.sajip/distlib/commits/1e44690\n\n\nmatch_hostname code is also copied in the setuptools package.\n\n- 0.7 introduced the code when it add support for SSL certificate verification\n  https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/commits/8dc5794\n- 0.9.5 corrected CVE-2013-2099\n  https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/commits/4b0fb61\n- 1.3 corrected CVE-2013-7440\n  https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/commits/7eeb678\n\npython-setuptools in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and earlier are based on upstream versions prior to 0.7 and hence do not contain match_hostname.  The version in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 is 0.9.8.  However, it does not contain match_hostname, as it was patched to use implementation from the python-backports-ssl_match_hostname package.  Version 0.9.8 is also used in python-setuptools packages in python27 and python33 collections in Red Hat Software Collections.  Those packages already include a patch for CVE-2013-7440.  The rh-python34 collections contains newer upstream setuptools versions (11.3.1)."
