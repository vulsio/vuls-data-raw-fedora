Xen\ntherefore needs to do the same.\n\nNote that part of said workaround was the subject of XSA-52.\n\nIMPACT\n======\n\nA malicious domain may be able to leverage this to obtain sensitive\ninformation such as cryptographic keys from another domain.\n\nVULNERABLE SYSTEMS\n==================\n\nXen versions 4.0 and onwards are vulnerable.  Any kind of guest can\nexploit the vulnerability.\n\nThe vulnerability is exposed only on AMD x86 systems.  Intel and ARM\nsystems do not expose this vulnerability.\n\nBoth PV and HVM guests are affected.\n\nMITIGATION\n==========\n\nThe vulnerability can be avoided if the guest kernel is controlled by\nthe host rather than guest administrator, provided that further steps\nare taken to prevent the guest administrator from loading code into\nthe kernel (e.g. by disabling loadable modules etc) or from using\nother mechanisms which allow them to run code at kernel privilege.\n\nOn Xen versions 4.3 and earlier, turning off XSAVE support via the\n\"no-xsave\" hypervisor command line option will avoid the vulnerability.\n\nOn Xen versions 4.4 and onwards there is no other known mitigation."
