						"thetext": "Similar to CVE-2015-7977, to exploit this issue, the attacker has to rely on two factors:\n\n* ntpd to be configured to receive mode 7 packets. By default on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, ntpd is configured to receive this packets only on localhost.\n\n* the restriction list must contain a large number of entries (more than 5000).\n\nWhen the number of entries is large enough, ntpd will crash due to stack exhaustion while recursively traversing the list.\n\nSince the attacker has no way of influencing the size of the restriction list by adding more entries, it is quite unlikely to exploit this issue.\n\nHaving such a large number of restriction entries would also be an uncommon configuration since it would be more practical to restrict connecting clients via other means (e.g. iptables) should the system require it.\n\nStatement:\n\nThis issue affects the versions of ntp as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7. Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having Moderate security impact. A future update may address this issue in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7.

This makes the value known to the attacker and a spoofed packet with a zero originate timestamp will pass the TEST2.\n\nThis means an off-path attacker can disrupt the synchronization with KoD packets, similar to CVE-2015-7704, or they can push arbitrary offset/delay measurements to the client, taking full control over the clock or cause ntpd to exit with an offset larger than the panic threshold."
