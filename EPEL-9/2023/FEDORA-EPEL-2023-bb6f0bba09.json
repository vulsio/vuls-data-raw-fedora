Unfortunately this mechanism can be used by an attacker with\nthe ability to send queries to the recursor, guess the correct source port of the corresponding\noutgoing query and inject packets with a spoofed IP address to force the recursor to mark specific\nauthoritative servers as not available, leading a denial of service for the zones served by those\nservers.\n\nCVSS 3.0 score: 3.7 (Low)\nhttps://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L\n\nThanks to Xiang Li from Network and Information Security Laboratory, Tsinghua University for reporting this issue."
