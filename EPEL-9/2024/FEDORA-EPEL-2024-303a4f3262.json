Install Fedora 38 (in a VM with clipboard sharing disabled) and all updates (using the 'Software' app).\n2. sudo dnf install mono-devel\n3. Download 'KeePass-2.53.1.zip' from https://keepass.info/download.html and extract it.\n4. Open a Terminal and run 'journalctl -f'.\n5. Open another Terminal tab and run 'mono KeePass.exe &>/tmp/log'.\n6. Create a new database. Copy the password of the first example entry (the password is 'Password') to the clipboard and wait until KeePass clears it automatically (12 seconds). Do the same for the second example entry (password '12345'). Wait again and then close KeePass.\n\nWhen inspecting the journalctl output, the KeePass output (Terminal) and the '/tmp/log' file, I cannot find the passwords. The journalctl output mainly contains window manager warnings, the KeePass output (Terminal) nothing and the '/tmp/log' file only a 'Gtk not found...' message; nothing seems to be related to the clipboard.\n\nIf xsel is installed, KeePass calls it for clipboard operations (transferring the data via stdin/stdout of xsel), because on some systems, Mono's clipboard methods do not work properly. On a new Fedora 38 system, xsel is not installed, thus I then installed xsel (sudo dnf install xsel) and repeated the test above, but the result is the same, i.e. I cannot find the passwords in any of the 3 locations."

The root of the issue could also be outside of xsel.\n\nWhen testing xsel on the systems above, I also tested whether the clipboard workarounds in KeePass are still required. Fortunately, the methods of the Clipboard class (implemented by Mono) now work fine on the systems above. So, the workarounds probably aren't required anymore for most users.\n\nTherefore, the clipboard workarounds will be disabled by default in the next KeePass version (2.54, probably released in about 1-2 weeks). This avoids the CVE issue for KeePass.\n\nHere's the latest development snapshot, if you want to test it:\nhttps://keepass.info/filepool/KeePass_230525.zip\n\nIf there are a few users who still need the clipboard workarounds, they can enable them explicitly with the command line parameter '-wa-enable:1530,1613'. In this case, the user should of course check whether the clipboard content is logged.\n\nThanks for your help!"

My educated guess is that the commit fixing the output logic is this one from 2010:\nhttps://github.com/kfish/xsel/commit/79748acf3045546a4d8ae444de99bb7a07d16eb7\nFedora, on the other hand, ships 1.2.0 with only a handful of patches:\nhttps://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/xsel/tree/rawhide\nIt still does not explain why on my machine both xsel and xdotool were needed to reproduce the problem. In any case, it appears that xsel is the culprit."
