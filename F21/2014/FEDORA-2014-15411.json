All rhels have this.\n\nThis is the TLS renegotiation SCSV which is different than the TLS fallback SCSV. However, the attack as I understand it does not apply on clients that rely on the TLS protocol negotiation. It applies to clients that do the \"browser\"-like negotiation which is to connect using TLS1.2, if that doesn't work, discard everything, and retry TLS 1.1... and so on until you do SSL 3.0.\n\nGnuTLS does not provide an API to do that trickery, and does not even discuss that as an option. I think that this attack affects mostly browsers rather than applications that properly use TLS/SSL."

						"thetext": "Note that there are two problems outlined in the paper linked in comment 0:\n\n- efficient padding oracle attack against SSL 3.0 CBC cipher suites\n- lack of ways to avoid MITM forced fallback in applications that implement re-connect SSL/TLS version fallback mechanism\n\n\nThe SSL 3.0 problem is yet another attack against the \"authenticate-then-encrypt\" constructions used by block ciphers in the cipher block chaining (CBC) mode, as used in SSL and TLS.  Previous attacks included BEAST / CVE-2011-3389 (bug 737506) or Lucky13 / CVE-2013-0169 (bug 907589).  The paper describes that when using SSL 3.0, only as little as 256 connections may be required to reliably decrypt one byte of cipher text.\n\nThe attack is similar to the BEAST attack - it requires that a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacker can make victim SSL client to repeatedly send the same secret information over SSL connection, mixed with attacker provided data.  Web browser is an example of such use case.  Attacker's script can make victim's browser send repeated requests to a target server.  Each request containing attacker controlled data (such as target path and GET/POST data) as well as secret information attacker wants to recover (such as authentication cookie).  A more detailed description of the browser attack can be found in the Adam Langley's blog post:\n\nhttps://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/10/14/poodle.html\n\nSSL 3.0 protocol issues that allow this attack are addressed, to some degree, in TLS - TLS 1.0 specifies format of message padding bytes, newer TLS versions define cipher suites using different modes.\n\nImplementations of SSL 3.0 protocols should be expected to get any fix to address this protocol problem.  Patches linked in comment 2 and comment 3 do not fix this issue, see below for more information on what they do.  One alternative may be to restrict use of CBC block ciphers with SSL 3.0, which leaves stream cipher RC4 as the only alternative.  RC4 has other known issues (see CVE-2013-2566 / bug 921947) and its use is discouraged.  It seems the only option will be to abandon the use of SSL 3.0.  See the Red Hat Knowledgebase article linked in comment 1 for instructions on how to disable the use of SSL 3.0 in various applications shipped as part of Red Hat products.\n\nAs SSL/TLS libraries used today usually support at least TLS version 1.0 (which is newer protocol version than SSL 3.0 despite having lower version number), often up to the currently latest TLS version 1.2, TLS 1.0 or newer is usually negotiated when SSL/TLS connection is created.  SSL/TLS protocols include a fallback mechanism which allows client and server to communicate even if the highest SSL/TLS version they support is not the same.  Client indicates the highest version it supports in its ClientHello handshake message, and server picks the highest version supported by both peers and communicates it back to client in its ServerHello handshake message.  SSL/TLS protocols implement protections to prevent MITM attacker from being able to tamper with handshake messages to force the use of the protocol version lower than the highest version supported by both client and server.  Which leads us to the second problem...\n\n\nCertain applications, most notably web browsers such as Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome, implement different fallback mechanism for compatibility reasons.  Some SSL/TLS implementation do not correctly handle cases when connecting client supports newer TLS protocol version than supported by the client, or when certain TLS extensions are used.  Instead of negotiating the highest TLS version supported by server, connection attempt may fail.  As a workaround, a web browser may attempt to re-connect with certain protocol versions disabled.  For example, browser may initially connect claiming TLS 1.2 as the highest supported version, and subsequently reconnect claiming only TLS 1.1, TLS 1.0 or eventually SSL 3.0 as the highest supported version until connection attempt succeeds.\n\nThis fallback mechanism makes it trivial for MITM attacker to force browser to use specific SSL/TLS version when talking to a web server.  Even if both client and server support TLS 1.2, they can be forced to use SSL 3.0 if both allow that protocol version, which makes it possible to mount a padding oracle attack as described above.\n\nPatches in comment 2 and comment 3, which implement the TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV protection defined in the following RFC draft:\n\nhttps://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tls-downgrade-scsv-00\n\naims to make this fallback mechanism safer by making it possible for applications to indicate if they are doing version fallback and that they can speak newer SSL/TLS protocol version.  Note that those fixes are insufficient if only applied to SSL/TLS libraries, client applications need to be modified to take advantage of the new feature.  The following conditions must be met to make TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV protection work:\n\n- SSL/TLS library used by an application doing re-connect fallback needs to implement TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV\n- application must be modified to instruct the SSL/TLS library to send TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV when doing fallback to older protocol version\n- SSL/TLS library used by the server must support TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV, no change to the server application is required\n\nIf server sees a connection attempt using SSL/TLS version lower than the highest protocol version it supports and that also includes TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV, it rejects the connection.\n\nNote that is re-connect version fallback commonly found in web browsers is uncommon in other applications or SSL/TLS libraries (i.e. it is not done by OpenSSL, NSS or GnuTLS)."

Updates add support for disabling specific SSL/TLS protocol versions using the jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms security property, and they also update the master security properties file, java.security, to add SSLv3 to the list of algorithms that are disabled by default.\n\nUsers who need to re-enable SSL 3.0 protocol support in OpenJDK or Oracle JDK can do so using one of the following ways:\n\n* Change the master security properties file to not include SSLv3 in the list of disabled algorithms.  The java.security files for each JDK can be found at the following path:\n\n  /usr/lib/jvm/*/jre/lib/security/java.security\n\nThe sub-directory under /usr/lib/jvm contains package name (such as java-1.7.0-openjdk or java-1.7.0-oracle) possibly followed by package version or architecture (depending on the JDK and its version).\n\nNote that the change to the file will affect all applications using given JDK.  Local changes to the file will also cause new java.security versions to be installed as java.security.rpmnew if future updates change packaged version, requiring manual merge of changes.\n\n* Re-enable SSLv3 support only for specific application or applications that require it.  Create a new security properties file that will override the default jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms setting from the master java.security, and use the java.security.properties system property to make Java read the file in addition to the master security properties file.  Example:\n\n  $ cat enable-ssl3.security \n  jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms=\n\n  $ java -Djava.security.properties=/path/to/enable-ssl3.security ...\n\nNote that this only works if the master security properties file sets the security.overridePropertiesFile security property to true.  That is the default setting in all OpenJDK and Oracle JDK packages shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux."

All rhels have this.\n\nThis is the TLS renegotiation SCSV which is different than the TLS fallback SCSV. However, the attack as I understand it does not apply on clients that rely on the TLS protocol negotiation. It applies to clients that do the \"browser\"-like negotiation which is to connect using TLS1.2, if that doesn't work, discard everything, and retry TLS 1.1... and so on until you do SSL 3.0.\n\nGnuTLS does not provide an API to do that trickery, and does not even discuss that as an option. I think that this attack affects mostly browsers rather than applications that properly use TLS/SSL."

								"thetext": "Note that there are two problems outlined in the paper linked in comment 0:\n\n- efficient padding oracle attack against SSL 3.0 CBC cipher suites\n- lack of ways to avoid MITM forced fallback in applications that implement re-connect SSL/TLS version fallback mechanism\n\n\nThe SSL 3.0 problem is yet another attack against the \"authenticate-then-encrypt\" constructions used by block ciphers in the cipher block chaining (CBC) mode, as used in SSL and TLS.  Previous attacks included BEAST / CVE-2011-3389 (bug 737506) or Lucky13 / CVE-2013-0169 (bug 907589).  The paper describes that when using SSL 3.0, only as little as 256 connections may be required to reliably decrypt one byte of cipher text.\n\nThe attack is similar to the BEAST attack - it requires that a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacker can make victim SSL client to repeatedly send the same secret information over SSL connection, mixed with attacker provided data.  Web browser is an example of such use case.  Attacker's script can make victim's browser send repeated requests to a target server.  Each request containing attacker controlled data (such as target path and GET/POST data) as well as secret information attacker wants to recover (such as authentication cookie).  A more detailed description of the browser attack can be found in the Adam Langley's blog post:\n\nhttps://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/10/14/poodle.html\n\nSSL 3.0 protocol issues that allow this attack are addressed, to some degree, in TLS - TLS 1.0 specifies format of message padding bytes, newer TLS versions define cipher suites using different modes.\n\nImplementations of SSL 3.0 protocols should be expected to get any fix to address this protocol problem.  Patches linked in comment 2 and comment 3 do not fix this issue, see below for more information on what they do.  One alternative may be to restrict use of CBC block ciphers with SSL 3.0, which leaves stream cipher RC4 as the only alternative.  RC4 has other known issues (see CVE-2013-2566 / bug 921947) and its use is discouraged.  It seems the only option will be to abandon the use of SSL 3.0.  See the Red Hat Knowledgebase article linked in comment 1 for instructions on how to disable the use of SSL 3.0 in various applications shipped as part of Red Hat products.\n\nAs SSL/TLS libraries used today usually support at least TLS version 1.0 (which is newer protocol version than SSL 3.0 despite having lower version number), often up to the currently latest TLS version 1.2, TLS 1.0 or newer is usually negotiated when SSL/TLS connection is created.  SSL/TLS protocols include a fallback mechanism which allows client and server to communicate even if the highest SSL/TLS version they support is not the same.  Client indicates the highest version it supports in its ClientHello handshake message, and server picks the highest version supported by both peers and communicates it back to client in its ServerHello handshake message.  SSL/TLS protocols implement protections to prevent MITM attacker from being able to tamper with handshake messages to force the use of the protocol version lower than the highest version supported by both client and server.  Which leads us to the second problem...\n\n\nCertain applications, most notably web browsers such as Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome, implement different fallback mechanism for compatibility reasons.  Some SSL/TLS implementation do not correctly handle cases when connecting client supports newer TLS protocol version than supported by the client, or when certain TLS extensions are used.  Instead of negotiating the highest TLS version supported by server, connection attempt may fail.  As a workaround, a web browser may attempt to re-connect with certain protocol versions disabled.  For example, browser may initially connect claiming TLS 1.2 as the highest supported version, and subsequently reconnect claiming only TLS 1.1, TLS 1.0 or eventually SSL 3.0 as the highest supported version until connection attempt succeeds.\n\nThis fallback mechanism makes it trivial for MITM attacker to force browser to use specific SSL/TLS version when talking to a web server.  Even if both client and server support TLS 1.2, they can be forced to use SSL 3.0 if both allow that protocol version, which makes it possible to mount a padding oracle attack as described above.\n\nPatches in comment 2 and comment 3, which implement the TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV protection defined in the following RFC draft:\n\nhttps://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tls-downgrade-scsv-00\n\naims to make this fallback mechanism safer by making it possible for applications to indicate if they are doing version fallback and that they can speak newer SSL/TLS protocol version.  Note that those fixes are insufficient if only applied to SSL/TLS libraries, client applications need to be modified to take advantage of the new feature.  The following conditions must be met to make TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV protection work:\n\n- SSL/TLS library used by an application doing re-connect fallback needs to implement TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV\n- application must be modified to instruct the SSL/TLS library to send TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV when doing fallback to older protocol version\n- SSL/TLS library used by the server must support TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV, no change to the server application is required\n\nIf server sees a connection attempt using SSL/TLS version lower than the highest protocol version it supports and that also includes TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV, it rejects the connection.\n\nNote that is re-connect version fallback commonly found in web browsers is uncommon in other applications or SSL/TLS libraries (i.e. it is not done by OpenSSL, NSS or GnuTLS)."

Updates add support for disabling specific SSL/TLS protocol versions using the jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms security property, and they also update the master security properties file, java.security, to add SSLv3 to the list of algorithms that are disabled by default.\n\nUsers who need to re-enable SSL 3.0 protocol support in OpenJDK or Oracle JDK can do so using one of the following ways:\n\n* Change the master security properties file to not include SSLv3 in the list of disabled algorithms.  The java.security files for each JDK can be found at the following path:\n\n  /usr/lib/jvm/*/jre/lib/security/java.security\n\nThe sub-directory under /usr/lib/jvm contains package name (such as java-1.7.0-openjdk or java-1.7.0-oracle) possibly followed by package version or architecture (depending on the JDK and its version).\n\nNote that the change to the file will affect all applications using given JDK.  Local changes to the file will also cause new java.security versions to be installed as java.security.rpmnew if future updates change packaged version, requiring manual merge of changes.\n\n* Re-enable SSLv3 support only for specific application or applications that require it.  Create a new security properties file that will override the default jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms setting from the master java.security, and use the java.security.properties system property to make Java read the file in addition to the master security properties file.  Example:\n\n  $ cat enable-ssl3.security \n  jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms=\n\n  $ java -Djava.security.properties=/path/to/enable-ssl3.security ...\n\nNote that this only works if the master security properties file sets the security.overridePropertiesFile security property to true.  That is the default setting in all OpenJDK and Oracle JDK packages shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux."

	"notes": "This release handles the recent POODLE vulnerability by disabling SSLv2/SSLv3\r\nby default for the most predominate uses of TLS in Node.js.\r\n\r\nIt took longer than expected to get this release accomplished in a way that\r\nwould provide appropriate default security settings, while minimizing the\r\nsurface area for the behavior change we were introducing. It was also important\r\nthat we validated that our changes were being applied in the variety of\r\nconfigurations we support in our APIs.\r\n\r\nWith this release, we are confident that the only behavior change is that of\r\nthe default allowed protocols do not include SSLv2 or SSLv3. Though you are\r\nstill able to programatically consume those protocols if necessary.\r\n\r\nIncluded is the documentation that you can find at\r\nhttps://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_protocol_support that describes how this\r\nworks going forward for client and server implementations.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nNode.js is compiled with SSLv2 and SSLv3 protocol support by default, but these\r\nprotocols are **disabled**. They are considered insecure and could be easily\r\ncompromised as was shown by CVE-2014-3566. However, in some situations, it\r\nmay cause problems with legacy clients/servers (such as Internet Explorer 6).\r\nIf you wish to enable SSLv2 or SSLv3, run node with the `--enable-ssl2` or\r\n`--enable-ssl3` flag respectively.  In future versions of Node.js SSLv2 and\r\nSSLv3 will not be compiled in by default.\r\n\r\nThere is a way to force node into using SSLv3 or SSLv2 only mode by explicitly\r\nspecifying `secureProtocol` to `'SSLv3_method'` or `'SSLv2_method'`.\r\n\r\nThe default protocol method Node.js uses is `SSLv23_method` which would be more\r\naccurately named `AutoNegotiate_method`. This method will try and negotiate\r\nfrom the highest level down to whatever the client supports.  To provide a\r\nsecure default, Node.js (since v0.10.33) explicitly disables the use of SSLv3\r\nand SSLv2 by setting the `secureOptions` to be\r\n`SSL_OP_NO_SSLv3|SSL_OP_NO_SSLv2` (again, unless you have passed\r\n`--enable-ssl3`, or `--enable-ssl2`, or `SSLv3_method` as `secureProtocol`).\r\n\r\nIf you have set `securityOptions` to anything, we will not override your\r\noptions.\r\n\r\nThe ramifications of this behavior change:\r\n\r\n * If your application is behaving as a secure server, clients who are `SSLv3`\r\nonly will now not be able to appropriately negotiate a connection and will be\r\nrefused. In this case your server will emit a `clientError` event. The error\r\nmessage will include `'wrong version number'`.\r\n * If your application is behaving as a secure client and communicating with a\r\nserver that doesn't support methods more secure than SSLv3 then your connection\r\nwon't be able to negotiate and will fail. In this case your client will emit a\r\nan `error` event. The error message will include `'wrong version number'`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n2014.10.20, node.js Version 0.10.33 (Stable)\r\n\r\n* child_process: properly support optional args (cjihrig)\r\n\r\n* crypto: Disable autonegotiation for SSLv2/3 by default (Fedor Indutny, Timothy J Fontaine, Alexis Campailla)\r\n\r\nThis is a behavior change, by default we will not allow the negotiation to\r\nSSLv2 or SSLv3. If you want this behavior, run Node.js with either\r\n`--enable-ssl2` or `--enable-ssl3` respectively.\r\n\r\nThis does not change the behavior for users specifically requesting\r\n`SSLv2_method` or `SSLv3_method`. While this behavior is not advised, it is\r\nassumed you know what you're doing since you're specifically asking to use\r\nthese methods.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n2014.10.21, libuv Version 0.10.29 (Stable)\r\n\r\nRelevant changes since version 0.10.28:\r\n\r\n* linux: try epoll_pwait if epoll_wait is missing (Michael Hudson-Doyle)\r\n",
