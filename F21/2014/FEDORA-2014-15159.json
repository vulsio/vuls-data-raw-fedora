I was able to get into the machine by using an external keyboard and then apply your patch.

Just to be sure, this was with hid-multitouch patched?\nIf so, then the upstream choice of using hid-microsoft instead of hid-multitouch makes sense because the touchpad is still in mouse emulation mode.\n\n--- Additional comment from Jerry Amundson on 2014-11-13 10:02:09 EST ---\n\nYes, hid-multitouch patched and insmod'd.\n\n--- Additional comment from Benjamin Tissoires on 2014-11-13 10:22:13 EST ---\n\nOK, thanks for the confirmation.\n\nJosh, do you think it would be possible to backport the following commit in the F21 (or even F20?) kernel tree?\n\nhttps://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/jikos/hid.git/commit/?h=for-3.19/microsoft&id=be3b16341d5cd8cf2a64fcc7a604a8efe6599ff0\n\nThis one is what will 3.19 get, so it should be safe to have it in Fedora.\n\n--- Additional comment from Josh Boyer on 2014-11-13 14:56:57 EST ---\n\nAdded to F20-rawhide kernels.

I have a rhel 7 iso on my ssd in >/Downloads. I fire up virt-manager, create a vm, accepting all the defaults and using the rhel7 iso. The setup is also default. The problems start when the install gets to actually yum all packages on the vm disk. It slows down to a crawl.\n\nI tried all settings in the mentioned links. The only thing that makes it fly again is adding nobarrier to the root mountpoint in fstab.\n\nWhen it's really slow I see an iostat %util at or near 100% on sda. When I pause the vm install it drops immediatly.\n\nyum/rpm seems to hit a disk in a very bad way. I do not only see this during the yum phase in a vm install, but also when doing a yum update or install on the box itself.\n\nI will attach an iostat output."

Like I sad in comment 1, the only thing that works for me, with or without this kernel version and with or without the GRUB options mentioned in the links.\n\nAFAICT, it is only this slow when using yum install or yum update with large packages. On L0 (the fedora box itself) I see it during yum update. On L1 (virt-manager) installing a RHEL7 vm from a RHEL7 iso on the same disk, I see it during the installation phase when the packages are actually being installed by anaconda. As soon as I add nobarrier to the affected filesystems in fstab, all is well and really really fast.\n\nTo confirm this is only with the SSD, I attached an external USB drive (rotational), mounted it without nobarrier and used it as a vm pool. When doing the same vm install there, it is fast as well."
