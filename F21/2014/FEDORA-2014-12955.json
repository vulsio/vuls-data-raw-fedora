Probably asking nicely the maintainers of these parts of the kernel, but I'm not sure who they are. I would have expected the people from chromium.org to be more proactive in pushing their patches upstream."

I only have a c720 not a c720p so I have no idea if the touchscreen also works.  Without these files the installed modules still work as well as suspend (with the previous fixes for that).  I wonder if this means we are closer to getting the patches needed into the offical fedora kernel."

For example, sometimes (I still couldn't figure out *what* triggers that) the touchpad becomes very non-sensive, which makes it extremely hard to move and point to where you want.  As I said, I am not sure what causes it.  Have you experienced this as well?\n\nI also could not get suspend to work yet, though that's a different issue..."

I confirmed that everything is running on the same version here, as you suggested.  However, I cannot get suspend to work.  Do you have it working?  Are you providing a different Linux flag on the boot?  If it is needed, I will open a new bug for it (I don't want to hijack this one)."

By looking at the Fedora package, I see that only a few patches have been added/removed from 3.16.2-201 to 3.16.3-200, but I'm not sure about the Linux tar.xz itself (haven't investigated).\n\nOTOH, since you haven't seen any problem when running the script, maybe that's not the issue.

Whenever I wake the computer from suspend it restarts.\nI have an Acer c720 with an Intel Celeron CPU.\nI tried the fixes here: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Chromebook#Fixing_suspend at the \"With systemd\" section, but no result.\n\nOn Ubuntu I used this fix (source: http://www.reddit.com/r/chrubuntu/comments/1rsxkd/list_of_fixes_for_xubuntu_1310_on_the_acer_c720/ch8eq2o ):\n  1. Create file /etc/initramfs-tools/scripts/init-top/unbind_ehci with following content http://pastebin.com/yk52qfKz \n  2. Change mode sudo chmod a+x /etc/initramfs-tools/scripts/init-top/unbind_ehci\n  3. Update initramfs sudo update-initramfs -k all -u\n  4. Add  \"tpm_tis.interrupts=0\" to /etc/default/grub and rebuild the grub configuration.\nBut this doesn't work on Fedora."

The device causing that is the ELAN touchscreen on my Fujitsu u904 laptop.\n\nApparently other people have similar issues which can be even worse (up to one minute delays). This is fixed in linux-next by introduction of a new quirk [1] and enabling it for the elan touchscreen [2]. Unfortunately the quirk only applies to a specific device so I sent a patch upstream to enable it for mine as well [3]. I have tested and confirmed that it works.\n\n1: http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git/commit/?id=2a159389bf5d962359349a76827b2f683276a1c7\n2: http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git/commit/?id=c68929f75dfcb6354918862b91b5778585de1fa5\n3: http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.usb.general/115688\n\nI am attaching them here for convenience (I rebased the first one to apply cleanly on 3.16).\n\nCan you please apply them for F20 and F21 ?"
