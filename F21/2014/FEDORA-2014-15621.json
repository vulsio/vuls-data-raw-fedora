	"notes": "* Fri Nov 21 2014 Jeffrey C. Ollie <jeff@ocjtech.us> - 11.14.1-1\r\n- The Asterisk Development Team has announced security releases for Certified\r\n- Asterisk 1.8.28 and 11.6 and Asterisk 1.8, 11, 12, and 13. The available\r\n- security releases are released as versions 1.8.28-cert3, 11.6-cert8, 1.8.32.1,\r\n- 11.14.1, 12.7.1, and 13.0.1.\r\n-\r\n- These releases are available for immediate download at\r\n- http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/releases\r\n-\r\n- The release of these versions resolves the following security vulnerabilities:\r\n-\r\n- * AST-2014-012: Unauthorized access in the presence of ACLs with mixed IP\r\n-   address families\r\n-\r\n-   Many modules in Asterisk that service incoming IP traffic have ACL options\r\n-   (\"permit\" and \"deny\") that can be used to whitelist or blacklist address\r\n-   ranges. A bug has been discovered where the address family of incoming\r\n-   packets is only compared to the IP address family of the first entry in the\r\n-   list of access control rules. If the source IP address for an incoming\r\n-   packet is not of the same address as the first ACL entry, that packet\r\n-   bypasses all ACL rules.\r\n-\r\n- * AST-2014-018: Permission Escalation through DB dialplan function\r\n-\r\n-   The DB dialplan function when executed from an external protocol, such as AMI,\r\n-   could result in a privilege escalation. Users with a lower class authorization\r\n-   in AMI can access the internal Asterisk database without the required SYSTEM\r\n-   class authorization.\r\n-\r\n- In addition, the release of 11.6-cert8 and 11.14.1 resolves the following\r\n- security vulnerability:\r\n-\r\n- * AST-2014-014: High call load with ConfBridge can result in resource exhaustion\r\n-\r\n-   The ConfBridge application uses an internal bridging API to implement\r\n-   conference bridges. This internal API uses a state model for channels within\r\n-   the conference bridge and transitions between states as different things\r\n-   occur. Unload load it is possible for some state transitions to be delayed\r\n-   causing the channel to transition from being hung up to waiting for media. As\r\n-   the channel has been hung up remotely no further media will arrive and the\r\n-   channel will stay within ConfBridge indefinitely.\r\n-\r\n- In addition, the release of 11.6-cert8, 11.14.1, 12.7.1, and 13.0.1 resolves\r\n- the following security vulnerability:\r\n-\r\n- * AST-2014-017: Permission Escalation via ConfBridge dialplan function and\r\n-                 AMI ConfbridgeStartRecord Action\r\n-\r\n-   The CONFBRIDGE dialplan function when executed from an external protocol (such\r\n-   as AMI) can result in a privilege escalation as certain options within that\r\n-   function can affect the underlying system. Additionally, the AMI\r\n-   ConfbridgeStartRecord action has options that would allow modification of the\r\n-   underlying system, and does not require SYSTEM class authorization in AMI.\r\n-\r\n- Finally, the release of 12.7.1 and 13.0.1 resolves the following security\r\n- vulnerabilities:\r\n-\r\n- * AST-2014-013: Unauthorized access in the presence of ACLs in the PJSIP stack\r\n-\r\n-   The Asterisk module res_pjsip provides the ability to configure ACLs that may\r\n-   be used to reject SIP requests from various hosts. However, the module\r\n-   currently fails to create and apply the ACLs defined in its configuration\r\n-   file on initial module load.\r\n-\r\n- * AST-2014-015: Remote crash vulnerability in PJSIP channel driver\r\n-\r\n-   The chan_pjsip channel driver uses a queue approach for relating to SIP\r\n-   sessions. There exists a race condition where actions may be queued to answer\r\n-   a session or send ringing after a SIP session has been terminated using a\r\n-   CANCEL request. The code will incorrectly assume that the SIP session is still\r\n-   active and attempt to send the SIP response. The PJSIP library does not\r\n-   expect the SIP session to be in the disconnected state when sending the\r\n-   response and asserts.\r\n-\r\n- * AST-2014-016: Remote crash vulnerability in PJSIP channel driver\r\n-\r\n-   When handling an INVITE with Replaces message the res_pjsip_refer module\r\n-   incorrectly assumes that it will be operating on a channel that has just been\r\n-   created. If the INVITE with Replaces message is sent in-dialog after a session\r\n-   has been established this assumption will be incorrect. The res_pjsip_refer\r\n-   module will then hang up a channel that is actually owned by another thread.\r\n-   When this other thread attempts to use the just hung up channel it will end up\r\n-   using a freed channel which will likely result in a crash.\r\n-\r\n- For more information about the details of these vulnerabilities, please read\r\n- security advisories AST-2014-012, AST-2014-013, AST-2014-014, AST-2014-015,\r\n- AST-2014-016, AST-2014-017, and AST-2014-018, which were released at the same\r\n- time as this announcement.\r\n-\r\n- For a full list of changes in the current releases, please see the ChangeLogs:\r\n-\r\n- http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/certified-asterisk/releases/ChangeLog-1.8.28-cert3\r\n- http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/certified-asterisk/releases/ChangeLog-11.6-cert8\r\n- http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/releases/ChangeLog-1.8.32.1\r\n- http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/releases/ChangeLog-11.14.1\r\n- http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/releases/ChangeLog-12.7.1\r\n- http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/releases/ChangeLog-13.0.1\r\n-\r\n- The security advisories are available at:\r\n-\r\n-  * http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/security/AST-2014-012.pdf\r\n-  * http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/security/AST-2014-013.pdf\r\n-  * http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/security/AST-2014-014.pdf\r\n-  * http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/security/AST-2014-015.pdf\r\n-  * http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/security/AST-2014-016.pdf\r\n-  * http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/security/AST-2014-017.pdf\r\n-  * http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/security/AST-2014-018.pdf\r\n\r\n* Fri Nov 21 2014 Jeffrey C.
