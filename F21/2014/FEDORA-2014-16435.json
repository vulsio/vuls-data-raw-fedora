This could allow an attacker to escalate their privileges if the <changeowner> configuration was used.\n\nThe following fix was added to icecast version 2.4.0:\n\nIn case of <changeowner> only UID and GID were changed, supplementary groups were left in place. This is a potential security issue only if <changeowner> is used. New behaviour is to set UID, GID and set supplementary groups based on the UID Even in case of icecast remaining in supplementary group 0 this \"only\" gives it things like access to files that are owned by group 0 and according to their umask. This is obviously bad, but not as bad as UID 0 with all its other special rights. It's a security issue and we fix immediately and recommend users to update.\n\nReferences:\nhttp://icecast.org/news/icecast-release-2_4_0/\nhttps://trac.xiph.org/changeset/19137/\nhttp://seclists.org/oss-sec/2014/q4/802"
