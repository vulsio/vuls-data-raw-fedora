This is due to lenient parsing of ASN.1 values involved in a signature and could lead to the forging of RSA certificates.\n\nThe Advanced Threat Research team at Intel Security also independently discovered and reported this issue.\n\nProjects using NSS 3.17 should update the new 3.17.1 release.\n\n\nExternal Reference:\n\nhttp://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2014/mfsa2014-73.html\n\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting this issue.

								"thetext": "Hi,\n\nWooCommerce is a WordPress plugin, and makes its http calls via the wp_remote_post() PHP function, which ultimately uses the PHP curl module.\n\nWhen an order is made via PayPal checkout, the transaction happens on the PayPal site. PayPal then call back via ordinary HTTP to the website via a configured address. The website then makes an outgoing https call to PayPal, to verify the legitimacy of the callback and the status of the transaction. In WooCommerce, this is done via wp_remote_post(), with an https://www.paypal.com URL as the parameter.\n\nWooCommerce was logging all the attempts to contact www.paypal.com via https from the time that the new nss was installed as failures due to an inability to validate www.paypal.com's SSL certificate.\n\nPayPal allows these callback events to be replayed arbitrarily. I tried a few, and they all resulted in the same failure. I then checked my yum logs, downgraded the nss-* set of packages (the only thing to have changed), replayed the callbacks, and they all worked.\n\nFor the calls to stripe.com, this works more traditionally. The user types in their credit card number on my website (over an https connection to my website - and these were working fine, of course - I wouldn't have received any orders at all if it wasn't), and then the WooCommerce Stripe module makes POST requests to www.stripe.com to use its API. These also all failed - but there is no logging for these. I assume it was for the same reason. After downgrading nss-*, I contacted customers who had placed orders and tried to pay via Stripe, and those that came back and re-tried succeeded.\n\nNothing else was changed. Apache was not restarted."

To be fair, that's expected.\n\nAs a result, applications remained in a broken state with very little visibility. The damage was already done, at which point customers start to take notice and wonder what's up.\n\nGenerally speaking, customers who use automatic updates don't make it a habit to review CVE changelogs or Red Hat errata (not feigning ignorance).
