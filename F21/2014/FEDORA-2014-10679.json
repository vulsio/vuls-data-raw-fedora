This can allow arbitrary\n   sites to set cookies that then would get sent to a different and unrelated\n   site or domain.\n\n   INFO\n\n   Cookie parsing and use is opt-in by applications and is not enabled by\n   default.\n\n   libcurl's cookie parser has no Public Suffix awareness, so apart from\n   rejecting TLDs from being allowed it might still allow cookies for domains\n   that are otherwise widely rejected by ordinary browsers. See\n   https://publicsuffix.org/ for details.\n\nVersions 7.31.0 and later are affected.  Earlier versions are not affected.\n\nInformation about how to enable cookies is available from http://curl.haxx.se/docs/http-cookies.html\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the cURL project for reporting these issues. Upstream acknowledges Tim Ruehsen as the original reporter.\n\n\nStatement:\n\nThis issue did not affect the versions of curl as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, or 7."

Hence all current Fedora releases are affected by this problem.\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6 and 7 are not affected, as noted above."
