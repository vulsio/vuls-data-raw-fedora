This vulnerability\nhas been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2014-7829.\n\nVersions Affected:  >= 3.0.0\nNot affected:       <= 3.0.0, 4.2.0.beta4\nFixed Versions:     3.2.21, 4.0.12, 4.1.8\n\nImpact\n------\nSpecially crafted requests can be used to determine whether a file exists on\nthe filesystem that is outside the Rails application's root directory.  The\nfiles will not be served, but attackers can determine whether or not the file\nexists.  This vulnerability is very similar to CVE-2014-7818, but the\nspecially crafted string is slightly different.\n\nThis only impacts Rails applications that enable static file serving at\nruntime.  For example, the application's production configuration will say:\n\n  config.serve_static_assets = true\n\nAll users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the work arounds immediately.\n\nReleases \n-------- \nThe 3.2.21, 4.0.12 & 4.1.8 releases are available at the normal locations. \n\nWorkarounds \n----------- \nTo work around this issue, set config.serve_static_assets = false in an initializer.  This work around will not be possible in all hosting environments and upgrading is advised.\n\"\"\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the Ruby on Rails project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Behrouz Sadeghipour, Patrick Toomey of GitHub, and Remon Oldenbeuving of hackerone as the original, independent reporters."
