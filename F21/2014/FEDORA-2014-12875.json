In sysklogd, this is used by an array for selector matching; in rsyslogd an additional array is used.  The LOG_FAC() macro is used to extract the facility from a syslog PRI, which is used to address the arrays.  Unfortunately, the LG_FACMASK permits values up to 0x3f8 (1016 dec), which translates to 128 facilities.  As a result, any PRI values above 191 cause the LOG_NFACILITIES arrays to be overrun.\n\nIf a remote attacker is able to send unconditional data to the logging server, they could cause a crash in rsyslogd, preventing the server from collecting additional logs from remote sources."

						"thetext": "In sysklogd, the following place is where f_pmask[] over-read happens:\n\nhttp://git.infodrom.org/?p=infodrom/sysklogd;a=blob;f=syslogd.c;h=4c2014f;hb=release-1.4-1#l1596\n\nThe fac value was previously extracted from the received PRI value using LOG_FAC at:\n\nhttp://git.infodrom.org/?p=infodrom/sysklogd;a=blob;f=syslogd.c;h=4c2014f;hb=release-1.4-1#l1570\n\nf_pmask is an array with the size of 25 (LOG_NFACILITIES+1), and the maximum fac value is 127 (LOG_FACMASK >> 3, where LOG_FACMASK is 0x03f8 or 1016).  The f_pmask[] is member of the filed structure, followed by multiple other members of sufficient size to make over-read limited to the filed structure.\n\nhttp://git.infodrom.org/?p=infodrom/sysklogd;a=blob;f=syslogd.c;h=4c2014f;hb=release-1.4-1#l609\n\nHence this over-read can not cause sysklogd to crash.  The only impact is that the decision on whether and where the message should be logged depends on the contents of the memory outside of the f_pmask[], causing the message to be logged to unexpected destinations or not logged.  This impact is limited to the attacker-supplied message and does not affect other log messages processed by the syslog daemon.  Additionally, attacker in control of the PRI can choose a value from the range of valid values that would cause his log message logged into any of the configured log files, or sent do any of the configured log servers.  Therefore, this incorrect logging decision has no real security impact.\n\n\nThe rsyslog inherited the f_pmask[] check from sysklogd.  The following examples show the check in rsyslog 3.x and 5.x:\n\nhttp://git.adiscon.com/?p=rsyslog.git;a=blob;f=tools/syslogd.c;h=1028356;hb=v3-stable#l1015\nhttp://git.adiscon.com/?p=rsyslog.git;a=blob;f=runtime/rule.c;h=828c244;hb=v5-stable#l173\n\nThe enclosing structure has different members and layout from the original sysklogd filed structure.  In rsyslog, f_pmask[] over-read is not limited to the enclosing structure.  However, it is still short enough to make it unlikely to cause a rsyslog crash.\n\nhttp://git.adiscon.com/?p=rsyslog.git;a=blob;f=tools/syslogd.h;h=e866a16;hb=v3-stable#l53\nhttp://git.adiscon.com/?p=rsyslog.git;a=blob;f=runtime/rule.h;h=2b58587;hb=v5-stable#l30\n\nThe message mis-direction impact is the same as for sysklogd."

						"thetext": "Another problematic place is textpri(), a function used to format specified numeric PRI value into a human-readable \"facility.priority\" string.\n\n\nRelevant code in sysklogd is:\n\nhttp://git.infodrom.org/?p=infodrom/sysklogd;a=blob;f=syslogd.c;h=4c2014f;hb=release-1.4-1#l1508\n\nThe function iterates of an array of known facility names and values.  If the facility value is not found, NULL is used as a facility name in the snprintf() call.  On Linux/glibc, printf(\"%s\", NULL) is handled gracefully and does not cause crash.  Hence this does no cause sysklogd DoS.\n\nIn sysklogd, this function is called for every message, and the returned string is used in a message only printed when running in the debug mode.\n\n\nThe function is practically identical in the rsyslog 3.x code:\n\nhttp://git.adiscon.com/?p=rsyslog.git;a=blob;f=runtime/msg.c;h=22303ad;hb=v3-stable#l1592\n\nUnlike sysklogd, it is not used to format PRI value for inclusion in a debug message.  It is called when any template or conditional statement defined in the rsyslog configuration uses %pri-text% property.  This property is not used in the default configuration of rsyslog packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux.\n\n\nThe rsyslog 5.x code uses different implementation of the textpri() function:\n\nhttp://git.adiscon.com/?p=rsyslog.git;a=blob;f=runtime/msg.c;h=8040933;hb=v5-stable#l2244\n\nThe numeric facility value is directly used as index to the syslog_fac_names[] array.  Out of bounds read causes an invalid pointer to be used, reliably triggering rsyslog daemon crash.  As noted above, configurations using %pri-text% property are affected.\n\n\nThere are further differences to the function implementation in rsyslog 7.x:\n\nhttp://git.adiscon.com/?p=rsyslog.git;a=blob;f=runtime/msg.c;h=6341e03;hb=v7-stable#l2452\n\nIn addition to the syslog_fac_names[] access index, facility number is also directly used to index the len_syslog_fac_names[] array.  Over-read of that array may cause an unexpectedly high value to be passed as the 3rd argument to memcpy(), leading to a buffer over-write and memory corruption.  This can possibly lead to code execution, as mentioned in the upstream advisory.  It can also be used to reliably crash rsyslog daemon."

In sysklogd, this is used by an array for selector matching; in rsyslogd an additional array is used.  The LOG_FAC() macro is used to extract the facility from a syslog PRI, which is used to address the arrays.  Unfortunately, the LG_FACMASK permits values up to 0x3f8 (1016 dec), which translates to 128 facilities.  As a result, any PRI values above 191 cause the LOG_NFACILITIES arrays to be overrun.\n\nIf a remote attacker is able to send unconditional data to the logging server, they could cause a crash in rsyslogd, preventing the server from collecting additional logs from remote sources."

								"thetext": "In sysklogd, the following place is where f_pmask[] over-read happens:\n\nhttp://git.infodrom.org/?p=infodrom/sysklogd;a=blob;f=syslogd.c;h=4c2014f;hb=release-1.4-1#l1596\n\nThe fac value was previously extracted from the received PRI value using LOG_FAC at:\n\nhttp://git.infodrom.org/?p=infodrom/sysklogd;a=blob;f=syslogd.c;h=4c2014f;hb=release-1.4-1#l1570\n\nf_pmask is an array with the size of 25 (LOG_NFACILITIES+1), and the maximum fac value is 127 (LOG_FACMASK >> 3, where LOG_FACMASK is 0x03f8 or 1016).  The f_pmask[] is member of the filed structure, followed by multiple other members of sufficient size to make over-read limited to the filed structure.\n\nhttp://git.infodrom.org/?p=infodrom/sysklogd;a=blob;f=syslogd.c;h=4c2014f;hb=release-1.4-1#l609\n\nHence this over-read can not cause sysklogd to crash.  The only impact is that the decision on whether and where the message should be logged depends on the contents of the memory outside of the f_pmask[], causing the message to be logged to unexpected destinations or not logged.  This impact is limited to the attacker-supplied message and does not affect other log messages processed by the syslog daemon.  Additionally, attacker in control of the PRI can choose a value from the range of valid values that would cause his log message logged into any of the configured log files, or sent do any of the configured log servers.  Therefore, this incorrect logging decision has no real security impact.\n\n\nThe rsyslog inherited the f_pmask[] check from sysklogd.  The following examples show the check in rsyslog 3.x and 5.x:\n\nhttp://git.adiscon.com/?p=rsyslog.git;a=blob;f=tools/syslogd.c;h=1028356;hb=v3-stable#l1015\nhttp://git.adiscon.com/?p=rsyslog.git;a=blob;f=runtime/rule.c;h=828c244;hb=v5-stable#l173\n\nThe enclosing structure has different members and layout from the original sysklogd filed structure.  In rsyslog, f_pmask[] over-read is not limited to the enclosing structure.  However, it is still short enough to make it unlikely to cause a rsyslog crash.\n\nhttp://git.adiscon.com/?p=rsyslog.git;a=blob;f=tools/syslogd.h;h=e866a16;hb=v3-stable#l53\nhttp://git.adiscon.com/?p=rsyslog.git;a=blob;f=runtime/rule.h;h=2b58587;hb=v5-stable#l30\n\nThe message mis-direction impact is the same as for sysklogd."

								"thetext": "Another problematic place is textpri(), a function used to format specified numeric PRI value into a human-readable \"facility.priority\" string.\n\n\nRelevant code in sysklogd is:\n\nhttp://git.infodrom.org/?p=infodrom/sysklogd;a=blob;f=syslogd.c;h=4c2014f;hb=release-1.4-1#l1508\n\nThe function iterates of an array of known facility names and values.  If the facility value is not found, NULL is used as a facility name in the snprintf() call.  On Linux/glibc, printf(\"%s\", NULL) is handled gracefully and does not cause crash.  Hence this does no cause sysklogd DoS.\n\nIn sysklogd, this function is called for every message, and the returned string is used in a message only printed when running in the debug mode.\n\n\nThe function is practically identical in the rsyslog 3.x code:\n\nhttp://git.adiscon.com/?p=rsyslog.git;a=blob;f=runtime/msg.c;h=22303ad;hb=v3-stable#l1592\n\nUnlike sysklogd, it is not used to format PRI value for inclusion in a debug message.  It is called when any template or conditional statement defined in the rsyslog configuration uses %pri-text% property.  This property is not used in the default configuration of rsyslog packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux.\n\n\nThe rsyslog 5.x code uses different implementation of the textpri() function:\n\nhttp://git.adiscon.com/?p=rsyslog.git;a=blob;f=runtime/msg.c;h=8040933;hb=v5-stable#l2244\n\nThe numeric facility value is directly used as index to the syslog_fac_names[] array.  Out of bounds read causes an invalid pointer to be used, reliably triggering rsyslog daemon crash.  As noted above, configurations using %pri-text% property are affected.\n\n\nThere are further differences to the function implementation in rsyslog 7.x:\n\nhttp://git.adiscon.com/?p=rsyslog.git;a=blob;f=runtime/msg.c;h=6341e03;hb=v7-stable#l2452\n\nIn addition to the syslog_fac_names[] access index, facility number is also directly used to index the len_syslog_fac_names[] array.  Over-read of that array may cause an unexpectedly high value to be passed as the 3rd argument to memcpy(), leading to a buffer over-write and memory corruption.  This can possibly lead to code execution, as mentioned in the upstream advisory.  It can also be used to reliably crash rsyslog daemon."
