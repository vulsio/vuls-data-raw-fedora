Come on Frank, surely you know that.\n\nThe problem is this is unconditional upstream.  That means that upstream will never have kernel builds with ths gcc option present, which means anyone that reverts this is deviating from upstream in a way that upstream can't (or more likely won't) recreate.  This may be theoretical, but it's still a concern.  A concern that seems warranted give the issue the prompted this in the first place.\n\nI'll try and argue again for it at least being conditional like DEBUG_INFO is. I'd rather at least have this configurable upstream.  It should be fairly easy to make a case for this given that it breaks multiple things on multiple distros (if I understand the problem fully)."

Which is exactly what you're going to have to do with every other distribution or upstream kernel built.\n\nI tried getting it to be configurable, but I am certainly not the best person to argue on behalf of systemtap.  I am nothing more than an ill informed middle man in that case.  I'd suggest restarting the conversation upstream and/or proposing alternative tests that could be run to verify gcc has the bug fixed at kernel build time."

This isn't acceptable in a production environment.\n\nAn \"acceptable\" fix would be to start all threads anyway and offline the ones that need to be to honour the requested SMT mode AFTER subcores init. This requires a non-trivial patch.\n\nSince changing SMT mode from userspace when the system is booted is really straightforward, Michael Ellerman suggests we simply drop that smt-enabled= feature.\n\nSmorigo,\n\nWhy were you using smt-enabled= ? Is there a reason not to do it after the system is booted with\nppc64_cpu --smt or writing directly to /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/online ?\n\n== Comment: #10 - Paulo Flabiano Smorigo <pfsmorigo@br.ibm.com> - 2014-12-01 06:23:34 ==\nI used smt-enabled= because for me was the easier way to disable it. Like, add this parameter in GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX and done. :)\n\nI'll check if there is a problem to drop it.\n\n== Comment: #11 - Paulo Flabiano Smorigo <pfsmorigo@br.ibm.com> - 2014-12-01 08:30:55 ==\nGreg, are you saying to dropping it for good? Maybe we can add that as a feature request for next year. Btw, I'm ok with drop it for now.\n\n== Comment: #12 - Greg Kurz <KURZGREG@fr.ibm.com> - 2014-12-01 09:30:00 ==\n(In reply to comment #11)\n> Greg, are you saying to dropping it for good? Maybe we can add that as a\n> feature request for next year. Btw, I'm ok with drop it for now.\n\nYes, drop it for good as suggested by Michael Ellerman...\n\n<mpe> groug: that smt-enabled stuff is just a hack. It leaves the cpu executing wherever it happens to be, possibly in firmware, possibly busy looping somewhere, it's really no good for use in production\n<mpe> the only way we could make it usable I think is to have the cpu come up, and then we offline it\n<mpe> but I'm really inclined to say that should just be done in userspace\n<groug> mpe, yeah... I had thought of something similar (starting and then offlining) but I agree it should be handled from userspace\n<mpe> I'll talk to benh and anton about it tomorrow, but I think we just rip it out\n\nThe point is that it is already extremely easy to change SMT mode from an init script and you get the same result... compared to the hassle of doing it in the kernel without breaking things. Not even worth a feature request I would say.\n\n== Comment: #13 - Greg Kurz <KURZGREG@fr.ibm.com> - 2014-12-12 08:50:25 ==\n\n------- Comment From hellerda@us.ibm.com 2014-12-13 05:29 EDT-------\nHi RH,\n\nThe request is to pick up the above patch.  Thx."
