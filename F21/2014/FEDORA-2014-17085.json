However, instead of removing (albeit currently useless) PAR::Packer's manpage, you should really patch nss-tools.  I'm not sure what to recommend there -- perhaps rename the manpage to nss-pp.  Or move it out of MANPATH, given the command itself isn't readily available in most people's PATH anyway."

Some of those so called \"unsupported\" tools are quite popular, useful when folks file bugs and need to provide us extra information, and we actually actively maintain them. When the man pages effort started the plan was for the supported ones only but several users requested that a subset of the \"unsupported\" ones be documented as well. \n\n> This is a matter of principle.
