This assumption is wrong if *alinelen (the number of bytes used in the buffer prior to reallocation) is lower than linesize (the total length of the buffer), or in other words, if the buffer is not completely full.\n\nIn that case, a fragment of the input line is subsequently written past the end of the buffer at line 856:\n\n*dst = *src++;\n\nI'm not sure if it is really exploitable, but in general this routine is processing arbitrary data coming from certificates the user happens to encounter somehow, so one could possibly exploit this using specially crafted certificate or something like that.\n\nAttached is a trivial patch fixing the issue (works fine for me during daily use of KMail with e-mail signing/encryption).\n\nVersion-Release number of selected component (if applicable):\ngpgme-1.3.2-4.fc20.x86_64\n\nHow reproducible:\nPerfectly reproducible for me, but as the bug is data-dependent and I'm not going to publish my keys, I don't have a simple testcase.
