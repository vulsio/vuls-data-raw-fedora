There are an existing checks to ensure if coc->compno / rgn->compno is not more than dec->numcomps.  The reason is that compno is later used as index to jpc_dec_cp_t's ccps[] array, which is allocated to have numcomps entries.  However, compno == numcomps is already out of allocated bounds, and the checks should be adjusted to error out when compno >= numcomps, rather than when compno > numcomps.\n\nThere is similar issue in jpc_dec_process_qcc which is also corrected by this patch."
