A little tricky to download it under the 3.16 (wireless-working) kernel, but then install under the 3.17 (wireless-nonworking) kernel.\n\nIt seemed to install OK (I see the \"wl\" module when I do the lsmod command)\nbut did not recognize my chipset (BCM4318). This page: \n\nhttp://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/fedora-linux-install-broadcom-wl-sta-wireless-driver-for-bcm43228/\n\ndoes not list BCM4318 as one of the supported chipsets, so maybe that's not surprising.\n\nI think even if it did work, this should still be considered a kernel bug, since there's a clear regression from the 3.16 kernel."

If this is a prebuilt kernel, it can likely be found at /proc/config.gz. I do not think this is a kernel bug/regression, but I really suspect a configuration problem. In particular, look for the value of CONFIG_B43_PHY_G. It *must* be \"y\". This is a new parameter that was added in June 2014. Previously, this functionality was always present, but it is now possible to not include it so as to make the kernel as small as possible."
