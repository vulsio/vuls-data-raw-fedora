						"thetext": "In https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1035316 , we decided to stop writing vconsole.keymap=(user's layout) to grub2.cfg again, because it's no longer needed for the original purpose, and doing it was preventing you changing the layout post-install cleanly.\n\nHowever, after working on https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=881624 for the last two days, I think that unless we compensate, this change will unfortunately break that *again*, for yet another different reason.\n\nupgrade.img, being a generic initramfs, does not include a vconsole.conf that reflects the configuration of the system being upgraded. Obviously, we can't read vconsole.conf from the installed system before decrypting it if it's encrypted. But fedup uses new-kernel-pkg to set up its grub2.cfg line, so as long as anaconda's writing 'vconsole.keymap' to grub2.cfg (and the user doesn't remove it), fedup's boot entry will get it too. So when we boot to fedup stage2, we do know what the user's chosen layout is (or at least, the one they chose when first installing the system...) because it's on the cmdline. Whew.\n\nNow we're not going to write that any more, though, I think fedup stage2 will have no keyboard layout configuration to read from anywhere.\n\nThe only way I can think of to deal with this would be for fedup to somehow get the configuration into the stage2 environment somehow: either modify the initramfs, or read it from vconsole.conf and write it into grub.cfg. But maybe there's a possibility I missed.\n\nAs we took this as a blocker for F20, nominating it as an F21 Beta blocker pre-emptively."

Which suggests that stuff should be factored out of dracut (or at least made available outside of dracut).\n\nThis would also be needed in the case of, say, 3rd party storage modules - you're going to need some way to get your module crammed into the upgrade.img if you want upgrade.img to be able to mount the root device.\n\n\nAside about \"stage2\": Fedup only uses one image, so there's no stage1/stage2 split like anaconda. There *is* a split between:\n  1) the part that sets up the system (\"fedup\", \"fedup-cli\", \"download tool\")\n  2) the part that actually does the upgrade (\"fedup-dracut\", \"upgrade.img\"),\n     which (confusingly) has *three* stages:\n     a) initramfs finds, maybe unlocks, and mounts root \n     b) inside the root device, we set up all the system's mounts\n     c) back in initramfs, with the disks all mounted, we run the upgrade\nSo \"stage2\" is kind of ambiguous, but I assume you mean 2a) - upgrade.img trying to mount root."

Or were you planning on submitting a patch or something?\n\nIn the scenario where that doesn't get done in time for F21, can we consider something which checks via localed or reading vconsole.conf what the keyboard layout is, and writing it into the kernel parameters? This shouldn't be too hard, as new-kernel-pkg has a parameter for it: \"--kernel-args=args\" . So the bare bones would just be to read 'KEYMAP=' out of vconsole.conf or ask localed for the VC keymap (it has a python interface IIRC, or you can grep localectl output, I guess), and pass the value found (if anything) to --kernel-args rd.vconsole.keymap= or --kernel-args vconsole.keymap= in fedup's new-kernel-pkg call, I think. \n\nIf there's already a vconsole.keymap parameter in the cmdline...I guess we shouldn't write any additional parameter, to be consistent with what would be the normal case in such a configuration...\n\nOn the aside: thanks, I wasn't sure what the terminology was. Indeed, by 'stage2' I meant your '2a)'."

If they haven't explicitly asked for a Product, they should just get upgraded to nonproduct by default. They have installed Fedora, not \"Fedora Workstation\", \"Fedora Server\" nor \"Fedora Cloud\".\n\nThe point of an upgrade is to preserve the existing installed package set as much as possible. (Otherwise, the user would be doing a reinstall.) So installing the whole @^%s-product-environment group is a very unexpected behavior (and also not clear from the upgrading message that that will happen if the user doesn't opt out). And if the user had a working GNOME, server or cloud installation of the existing Fedora, that should continue working just fine after the upgrade even without being a Product nor forcing its default package set to be added.\n\nIn addition, due to the wording of the message, which not only does not clearly present the implications of selecting a Product (nor the non-implications of the scary \"nonproduct\" option, which is actually what 99% of users upgrading will want: an upgrade preserving the existing package selection), but also does not make it clear that \"workstation\" is GNOME, I suspect that we will get many user complaints about FedUp adding the whole GNOME on upgrades of Fedora KDE 20 to Fedora 21. I also suspect that even GNOME, server and cloud users will complain about having packages added that they didn't ask for (e.g. because they explicitly removed unneeded desktop applications in the past, or because they did a minimum netinstall for their server and now got talked into using the \"server\" Product by the misleading message)."

If fedup is not passed a --product=<something> command, it will print a message indicating what the choices are and instruct the user to re-run the command.\n\nThe current text displayed to the end-user is as follows:\n\n{{{\nThis installation of Fedora does not belong to a product, so you\nmust provide the --product=PRODUCTNAME option to specify what product\nyou want to upgrade to. PRODUCTNAME should be one of:\n\n workstation: the default Fedora experience for laptops and desktops\n server: the default Fedora experience for servers\n cloud: a base image for use on public and private clouds\n nonproduct: choose this if none of the above apply; in particular,\n   choose this if you are using an alternate-desktop spin of Fedora\n}}}\n\n\nIf you feel that we should alter the text of \"workstation\" to something like \"The default Fedora experience for laptops and desktops, powered by GNOME\", then that's a perfectly reasonable request. I'd ask you kindly to open a new bug on that, since this bug is strictly about the upgrade mechanism. That's essentially a documentation change."

As far as I know, the KDE SIG was not asked at all. And have you tried asking actual users, too? Of course, if you discuss this only with the Product WGs, they'll tell you that everyone wants a Product…\n\n> 1) The focus of Fedora 21 is on the Products.

To me, it is obvious that a user who installed with Fedora 20 will expect to keep the package set he/she had installed Fedora 20 with, unless he/she explicitly asks for --product=something. This is how upgrades have always worked since Red Hat Linux days. They have NEVER pulled in new packages (that are not either required by existing packages or obsolete existing packages).\n\n> The design of Fedora's products dictates the expected behavior\n\nSorry, but I don't see how it does. The expected behavior is clearly that --product=nonproduct is the automatic default.\n\n> Please take that to the mailing lists.\n\nBut we will take this to the devel mailing list."

But it's not required for F19->F20 upgrades.\n\nAlso note for F19: right now the error message won't appear for DVD/ISO upgrades to F21+ *without* --network, because we can't tell at CLI-parsing time what distro version the DVD/ISO is.\n\nBut I'm pretty sure network-disconnected leap-upgrades are rare, and officially they're not supported so that doesn't *need* to be fixed. Would probably be better if it was, but that's low-priority at this point. Patches welcome, though."
