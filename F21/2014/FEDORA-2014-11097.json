If you find an option that works I'll give you a kernel-build with a patch which makes the kernel automatically do the right thing to test, and once you've successfully tested that kernel I'll send that patch upstream for integration into the official kernel, so that if in the future other people try to use Linux on their ASUS X550 things will just work."

So I've just spend some time fixing that bug :)\n\nI've put a copy of a fixed grub2 scratch build I've done here:\n\nhttp://people.fedoraproject.org/~jwrdegoede/grub2-rhbz923374/\n\nTo test this do the following:\n\n1) Run \"rpm -qa | grep grub2\" to see which grub2 packages you've installed\n2) Download the relevant packages\n3) run \"rpm -Uvh grub2*.rpm\" to install the new version\n4) reboot\n\nNote:\n1) Upgrading your bootloader always brings a risk of ending up with a non bootable machine with it !\n2) This is a build for f21, but you can install it on f20 without problems\n3) No need to run grub2-install since this only affects machines booting through EFI, where grub2-install is not necessary\n\nYou now should be able to use kernel cmdline arguments with spaces in there without issues, so please try using the dyndbg argument and collecting dmesg again.\n\nThanks,\n\nHans\n\n\np.s.\n\nI've one other thing for you to try, which should hopefully give you a working touchpad in ps/2 mouse emulation mode (so no 2 finger scrolling, etc.), and stop it from interfering with an external mouse. \n\nSounds good? Try booting with \"psmouse.proto=bare\" on the kernel cmdline. Note please also do try the grub update + dyndbg + dmesg collection, as ultimately we want the touchpad to work in its native mode. And sorry for not thinking about this sooner, I'm still a bit new to ps/2 touchpad problem debugging."

The above did not help me.\n\nOriginally, I created an entry for this laptop at:\nhttps://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=77391\n\nWith 8042.debug we can see that there are MUX errors. i8042.nomux=1 helps to get rid of them indeed. But it still does not work.\n\nAs a workaround, I use a USB mouse and i8042.noaux=1 (i.e. disable touchpad auxiliary port)."

						"thetext": "Hi Uwe,\n\nFirst of all thanks for the dmesg with the dyn_dbg option. It did work this time, unfortunately it did not really help to identify your touchpad. So I went to look at the pnp ids instead, as listed in this line of dmesg:\n\n[    0.224227] pnp 00:09: Plug and Play ACPI device, IDs FLT0101 SYN0a00 SYN0002 PNP0f03 PNP0f13 PNP0f12 (active)\n\nThe id telling us what sort of device you've is the FLT0101 pnp-id. After downloading Asus' latest windows touchpad drivers, and looking at the .inf files shipped with those. I've managed to finally identify your touchpad manufacturer. What I've learned is that there is a new touchpad manufacturer on the market now called FocalTech, and the Asus X450 and X550 seem to be the first laptops with a FocalTech touchpad. This is pad news as this means we've no native driver for the touchpad and we'll have to make do with the mouse emulation mode for now.\n\nThe windows drivers .inf files seem to indicate that your touchpad may also have an i2c interface (touchpads being interfaced through both ps/2 and i2c are becoming more standard now a days), and that the i2c interface uses the standard i2c-hid protocol. This is where Benjamin comes in, as he is the expert on i2c-hid.\n\nSo moving forward with this, I've prepared a kernel which contains 2 patch-sets relevant for your laptop:\n\n1) It contains a patch-set to the ps2 code to identify your touchpad based on the pnp-id and to stop the ps2 probing for other brand touchpads which was confusing your touchpad. So with this kernel you should be able to have things work (in mouse emulation mode) without specifying psmouse.proto=bare on the kernel commandline.\n\n2) As said with some luck we may be able to use your touchpad in native mode over i2c. So I've also added a patch to enable some extra i2c controllers found on haswell itd devices.\n\nCan you please download kernel-3...rpm for your arch from this kernel scratch build:\nhttps://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/taskinfo?taskID=7086051\n\n(note still building atm, should be done in about 30 minutes)\n\nAnd the install it with \"sudo rpm -ivh kernel...rpm\", and reboot into it without specifying any special kernel commandline parameters, and then:\n\n1) Check that the touchpad works in mouse emulation mode\n\n2) Do the following:\n  sudo yum install i2c-tools\n  sudo modprobe i2c-dev\n  sudo i2cdetect -l\n\n  And paste the output of the i2cdetect command here ?\n\nIf the outcome of 1). is successful then I'll send the patches for this upstream, so that other x450 / x550 users will have things just work ootb (in mouse emulation mode).\n\nBenjamin will get back to you on the outcome of the 2nd test.\n\nThanks & Regards,\n\nHans"

Is anybody\n> working on writing a \"proper\" touchpad driver? If so, please tell me, so\n> that we don't duplicate the work.\n\nIt is great to hear that you're working on this, AFAIK you are the first person working on this. Let me know if you need any help with writing the kernel driver, and please CC me when you submit the driver upstream, then I can review it for you.\n\nQuestion if you put down a finger, lets call this finger \"finger 1\" and then put down finger 2, and then lift finger 1, where in the packet does \"finger 2\" get reported ? If it jumps from slot 2 to slot 1 when this happens, then you've a so called Type A device, see Documentation/input/multi-touch-protocol.txt.\n\nIf you've a Type A device, then you need to use input_mt_assign_slots and input_mt_sync_frame so that the kernel will track which finger is one, turning the device into a \"Type B\" slot from userspace's pov. This is necessary because userspace only supports Type B touchpad devices. See drivers/input/mouse/alps.c alps_report_mt_data for an example, this works basically like this:\n\n1) Call input_mt_assign_slots passing in a \"slot\" integer array and an array of touch coordinates, and the amount of active touches. This will figure out to which previous slot each touch is closest and store which touch should end up in which slot accordingly to avoid fingers jumping from one slot to another.\n\n2) For each touch:\n2.1) Call input_mt_slot(dev, slot[i]) setting the active slot to the one assigned by input_mt_assign_slots\n2.2) Call input_mt_report_slot_state(dev, MT_TOOL_FINGER, true);\n2.3) Call input_report_abs(dev, ABS_MT_POSITION_X, x);\n2.4) Call input_report_abs(dev, ABS_MT_POSITION_Y, y);\n\n3) Commit all the touches with input_mt_sync_frame(dev);\n\n4) Report number of fingers down using input_mt_report_finger_count(dev, n);\n\n5) Report buttons\n\n6) Do input_sync(dev);\n\n\nAnd before using input_mt_foo you need to call:\n\n        input_mt_init_slots(dev1, MAX_TOUCHES, INPUT_MT_POINTER |\n                INPUT_MT_DROP_UNUSED | INPUT_MT_TRACK | INPUT_MT_SEMI_MT);\n\nNote the INPUT_MT_DROP_UNUSED automatically lifts fingers which do not have input_mt_report_slot_state(dev, MT_TOOL_FINGER, true) called on them since the last input_mt_sync_frame(dev);\n\nI hope this helps.\n\nRegards,\n\nHans"
