It's handy for testing UEFI support in the virt stack.\n\nLately I can't use it on F20, because curl - which yum uses for fetching packages - can't talk to the server. It spits an error:\n\ncurl: (35) Cannot communicate securely with peer: no common encryption algorithm(s).\n\nF20's wget can get stuff from the server fine.\n\nUsing -v, I can see curl's using its NSS backend (though ldd shows for some reason it's built against both nss and openssl).\n\nSSLlabs.com shows kraxel.org's cipher suite as:\n\nTLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 (0xc030)   ECDH 256 bits (eq. 3072 bits RSA)   FS\t\t256\nTLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 (0xc02f)   ECDH 256 bits (eq. 3072 bits RSA)   FS\t\t128\nTLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 (0x9f)   DH 4096 bits (p: 512, g: 1, Ys: 512)   FS\t\t256\nTLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 (0x9e)   DH 4096 bits (p: 512, g: 1, Ys: 512)   FS\t\t128\nTLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384 (0xc028)   ECDH 256 bits (eq. 3072 bits RSA)   FS\t\t256\nTLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256 (0xc027)   ECDH 256 bits (eq. 3072 bits RSA)   FS\t\t128\nTLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA256 (0x6b)   DH 4096 bits (p: 512, g: 1, Ys: 512)   FS\t\t256\nTLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256 (0x67)   DH 4096 bits (p: 512, g: 1, Ys: 512)   FS\t\t128\nTLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 (0x9d) \t256\nTLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA256 (0x3d) \t256\nTLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 (0x9c) \t128\nTLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256 (0x3c) \t128\n\nIt also only supports TLS 1.2, but I think curl should support 1.2 in F20. I can see from comparing curl-7.32.0/lib/nss.c (F20) and curl-7.37.0/lib/vtls/nss.c (F21) that curl only got SHA256 cipher support between those releases some time; would it be possible to backport it to the F20 curl?\n\nThanks!"

						"thetext": "Daniel Stenberg reported the following vulnerability in cURL:\n\n\"\"\nlibcurl's function curl_easy_duphandle() has a bug that can lead to libcurl\neventually sending off sensitive data that was not intended for sending.\n\nWhen doing an HTTP POST transfer with libcurl, you can use the\n`CURLOPT_COPYPOSTFIELDS` option to specify a memory area holding the data to\nsend to the remote server. The memory area's size is set with a separate\noption, for example `CURLOPT_POSTFIELDSIZE`.\n\nAs the name implies, the data in the specified buffer is copied to a privately\nheld memory buffer that libcurl allocates on the heap. The memory area is\nassociated with the common CURL handle, often referred to as an \"easy handle\".\n\nThis handle can be duplicated by an application to create an identical copy,\nand all the already set options and data is then also similarly cloned and\nwill be associated with the newly returned handle. This also includes the data\nto send in an HTTP POST request.\n\nThe internal libcurl function that duplicates options from the old handle to\nthe new had two problems:\n\n1. It mistakenly treated the post data buffer as if it was a C string. A C\n   string ends with a zero byte, and subsequently strdup() was used to\n   duplicate the post data buffer. A post data buffer can perfectly\n   legitimately contain a zero byte, or it may not contain any zero byte at\n   all (including no trailing one) - leading to strdup() either making a too\n   small duplicate, a too large one or crash due to reading an inaccessible\n   memory area. The strdup() of course allocates memory off the heap.\n\n2. After duplication of the handle data, the pointer used to read from when\n   sending the data was not updated. So when sending off the post, libcurl\n   would still read from the original handle's buffer which at that time could\n   have been freed or reused for other purposes.\n\nWhen libcurl subsequently constructs the HTTP POST request and includes data\nfor the protocol body it will memcpy() data from that pointer using the old\nsize and the old pointer. This makes a read from the wrong place and can lead\nto libcurl inserting data into the request that happens to be stored at that\nplaces in memory at that time.\n\nWe are not aware of anyone having been able to actually exploit this for\nnefarious purposes, but we can't exclude that it is possible or even might\nalready have been exploited.\n\nINFO\n----\n\nThis bug requires `CURLOPT_COPYPOSTFIELDS` and `curl_easy_duphandle()` to be\nused in that order, and then the duplicate handle must be used to perform the\nHTTP POST.\n\nThe curl tool is not affected, it does not use this sequence.\n\"\"\"\n\nThis issue affects versions 7.17.1 up to and including 7.38.0. It has been fixed in version 7.39.0\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the cURL project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Symeon Paraschoudis as the original reporter."

						"thetext": "This issue affects applications that set CURLOPT_COPYPOSTFIELDS options on a curl handle a subsequently duplicate the handle (using curl_easy_duphandle()).\n\nDuring the handle duplication, libcurl may read memory outside of the bounds of allocated buffer if POST data set using CURLOPT_COPYPOSTFIELDS was not NUL terminated.  The out of bounds access occurs in strdup()/strlen().  This can cause crash if unmapped memory is reached before NUL byte is found, but such crash is unlikely.\n\nDue to another bug in the handle duplication code, POST data in the copied handle is not used even if no new POST data are set before performing the request.  Instead, data from the buffer associated with the original handle is used.  Therefore, if the original handle is freed, or if new POST data is set on it between duplication and the use of the new handle, libcurl may use data from an already freed buffer.\n\nThere are no applications in Red Hat Enterprise Linux that uses libcurl in the way that would make them vulnerable to this issue.  The CURLOPT_COPYPOSTFIELDS option is only used by PHP, when PHP script sets CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS option with data that is not array or object.  As string arguments used with PHP curl_setopt(CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS) are unlikely to be NUL terminated, strdup() out of bounds read is likely to happen in curl_copy_handle().\n\nUpstream advisory lists curl versions 7.17.1 and later to be affected by this problem.  The version 7.17.1 is the one that introduced the CURLOPT_COPYPOSTFIELDS option.  The curl packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and earlier are based on older upstream curl versions and hence were not affected by this issue."
