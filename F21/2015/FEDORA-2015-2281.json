Most libc tzset() implementations support passing an\nabsolute pathname in the time zone to point to an arbitrary,\nuser-controlled file.  This may be used to exploit bugs in the C\nlibrary's TZ parser or open files the user would not otherwise have\naccess to.  Arbitrary file access via TZ could also be used in a\ndenial of service attack by reading from a file or fifo that will\nblock.\n\nBeginning with sudo 1.8.12, TZ is only passed through by default\nif it is considered \"safe\".  The TZ variable is now considered\n\"unsafe\" if any of the following are true:\n\n    o   It consists of a fully-qualified path name that\n        does not match the location of the zoneinfo directory.\n\n    o   It contains a \"..\" path element.\n\n    o   It contains white space or non-printable characters.\n\n    o   It is longer than the value of PATH_MAX.\n\nSudo versions affected:\n\nSudo versions prior to 1.8.12 are affected.\n\nDetails:\n\nUnix systems support a user-specified time zone value stored in the\nTZ environment variable.  On many systems, the value of TZ is ignored\nfor set user ID processes (such as sudo) if it does not pass certain\nsanity checks.  However, while the value may be ignored, it is not\nactually removed from the environment.  As such, a program run via\nsudo will inherit the (possibly malicious) value of TZ.\n\nA user with sudo access may take advantage of this to exploit bugs\nin the C library functions which parse the TZ environment variable.\nThe TZ handling in most C libraries (including GNU libc and the\ntzcode used by BSD and others) supports reading arbitrary files.\n\nBy setting TZ to a fully-qualified path name, a command run via\nsudo may be used to read (but not disclose the contents of) files\nthat the user would not otherwise be able to open.  This is generally\nbenign for regular files, but it may be possible to change the\nbehavior of the system by reading from device special files.  For\ninstance, it may be possible to hijack the output from a terminal\ndevice file, consume kernel log messages or cause a tape drive to\nchange position.  It may also be possible to cause a command run\nby sudo to hang if TZ is set to the value of a named pipe or a\ndevice special file that blocks on read.\n\nImpact:\n\nA user with sudo access may be able to exploit parsing bugs in the\ntime zone parsing functions of the system's C library functions.\nThe user may also be able to read arbitrary files, potentially\ncausing changes in system behavior when reading certain device\nspecial files or simply causing the program run via sudo to block.\n\nFix:\n\nThe bug is fixed in sudo 1.8.12.\n\n[1]: http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q1/486"
