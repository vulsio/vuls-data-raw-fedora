The bug is in the function parse_arth (and technicall parse_backtick and parse_comm should be hardened), it fails to check for WRDE_NOCMD when processing backticks. The expectation in the code was that higher levels would check for WRDE_NOCMD, and they do, but parse_arith does not, and that's sufficient to show the flaw in the design. Each of the parse_* functions that handles part of the input should be defensive and return errors if any unchecked expansions might pass them code which should be executed on the shell, particularly if you're about to call exec_comm.\n\nThe attached patch fixes the issue in parse_arith, parse_backtick and parse_comm. The parse_backtick and parse_comm are the *only* two functions that call the shell for expansion and in each of them we now check for WRDE_NOCMD. That should harden the entire interface against accidental execution of commands like \"$((1`echo +1`))\".\n\nCould someone please look into which RHEL versions have tha vulnerability?\n\nIt looks like:\n- Upstream (no OS).\n- Fedora Rawhide\n- Fedora F21\n- Fedora 20\n\nAre all impacted by this."

The backticks in the arithmetic\nepxression are evaluated by in a shell even if WRDE_NOCMD forbade\ncommand substitution. This allows an attacker to attempt to pass\ndangerous commands via constructs of the above form, and bypass\nthe WRDE_NOCMD flag. This patch fixes this by checking for WRDE_NOCMD\nin parse_arith(). The patch also hardens parse_backticks() and\nparse_comm() to check for WRDE_NOCMD flag and return an error instead\nof ever running a shell.\n\nWe expand the testsuite and add 3 new regression tests of roughtly\nthe same form but with a couple of nested levels.\n\nOn top of the 3 new tests we add fork validation to the WRDE_NOCMD\ntesting. If any forks are detected during the execution of a wordexp()\ncall with WRDE_NOCMD, the test is marked as failed. This is slightly\nheuristic since vfork might be used, but it provides a higher level\nof assurance that no shells were executed as part of command substitution\nwith WRDE_NOCMD in effect. In addition it doesn't require libpthread or\nlibdl, instead we use the public implementation namespace function\n__register_atfork (already part of the public ABI for libpthread).\n\nTested on x86_64 with no regressions.\n\n2014-10-27  Carlos O'Donell  <carlos@redhat.com>\n\n        * wordexp-test.c (__dso_handle): Add prototype.\n        (__register_atfork): Likewise.\n        (__app_register_atfork): New function.\n        (registered_forks): New global.\n        (register_fork): New function.\n        (test_case): Add 3 new tests for WRDE_CMDSUB.\n        (main): Call __app_register_atfork.\n        (testit): If WRDE_NOCMD set registered_forks to zero, run test, and\n        if fork count is non-zero fail the test.\n        * posix/wordexp.c (parse_arith): Return WRDE_NOCMD if WRDE_NOCMD flag\n        is set and parsing '`'.\n        (parse_comm): Return WRDE_NOCMD if WRDE_NOCMD flag is set.\n        (parse_backtick): Return WRDE_NOCMD if WRDE_NOCMD flag is set and\n        parsing '`'."

Clearing LD_LIBRARY_PATH, or pointing LD_LIBRARY_PATH at a directory which actually exists, resolves the problem.\n\nAdditional info:\nThe segmentation fault seems to occur when glib's _g_module_open()  calls dlopen() at gmodule-dl.c:97 The filename to be opened is /usr/lib64/gio/modules/libgvfsdbus.so -- part of gvfs2.\n\ndlopen() is given an absolute path, so it should not be searching per the man page: \"If  filename  contains  a slash (\"/\"), then it is\n       interpreted as a  (relative  or  absolute)  pathname.   Otherwise,  the\n       dynamic  linker  searches  for the library ... \" \n(Since filename contains a slash, the otherwise clause is not applicable, so dlopen() should not be searching)\n\ndlopen seems to be searching through LD_LIBRARY_PATH anyway (based on strace output) and a segmentation fault occurs several function calls deep. \n\nClearing LD_LIBRARY_PATH resolves the problem\n\nThis might be the root cause of bug #1177891"
