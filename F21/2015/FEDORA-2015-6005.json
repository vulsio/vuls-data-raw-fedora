	"notes": "The Asterisk Development Team has announced security releases for Certified\r\nAsterisk 1.8.28, 11.6, and 13.1 and Asterisk 1.8, 11, 12, and 13. The available\r\nsecurity releases are released as versions 1.8.28.cert-5, 1.8.32.3, 11.6-cert11,\r\n11.17.1, 12.8.2, 13.1-cert2, and 13.3.2.\r\n\r\nThese releases are available for immediate download at\r\nhttp://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/releases\r\n\r\nThe release of these versions resolves the following security vulnerability:\r\n\r\n* AST-2015-003: TLS Certificate Common name NULL byte exploit\r\n\r\n  When Asterisk registers to a SIP TLS device and and verifies the server,\r\n  Asterisk will accept signed certificates that match a common name other than\r\n  the one Asterisk is expecting if the signed certificate has a common name\r\n  containing a null byte after the portion of the common name that Asterisk\r\n  expected. This potentially allows for a man in the middle attack.\r\n\r\nFor more information about the details of this vulnerability, please read\r\nsecurity advisory AST-2015-003, which was released at the same time as this\r\nannouncement.\r\n\r\nFor a full list of changes in the current releases, please see the ChangeLogs:\r\n\r\nhttp://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/certified-asterisk/releases/ChangeLog-1.8.28-cert5\r\nhttp://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/releases/ChangeLog-1.8.32.3\r\nhttp://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/certified-asterisk/releases/ChangeLog-11.6-cert11\r\nhttp://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/releases/ChangeLog-11.17.1\r\nhttp://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/releases/ChangeLog-12.8.2\r\nhttp://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/certified-asterisk/releases/ChangeLog-13.1-cert2\r\nhttp://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/releases/ChangeLog-13.3.2\r\n\r\nThe security advisory is available at:\r\n\r\n * http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/security/AST-2015-003.pdf\nThe Asterisk Development Team has announced the release of Asterisk 11.17.0.\r\nThis release is available for immediate download at\r\nhttp://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk\r\n\r\nThe release of Asterisk 11.17.0 resolves several issues reported by the\r\ncommunity and would have not been possible without your participation.\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nThe following are the issues resolved in this release:\r\n\r\nNew Features made in this release:\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n * ASTERISK-17899 -

The available security releases are\r\nreleased as versions 11.6-cert9, 11.14.2, 12.7.2, and 13.0.2.\r\n\r\nThese releases are available for immediate download at\r\nhttp://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/releases\r\n\r\nThe release of these versions resolves the following security vulnerability:\r\n\r\n* AST-2014-019: Remote Crash Vulnerability in WebSocket Server\r\n\r\n  When handling a WebSocket frame the res_http_websocket module dynamically\r\n  changes the size of the memory used to allow the provided payload to fit. If a\r\n  payload length of zero was received the code would incorrectly attempt to\r\n  resize to zero. This operation would succeed and end up freeing the memory but\r\n  be treated as a failure. When the session was subsequently torn down this\r\n  memory would get freed yet again causing a crash.\r\n\r\nFor more information about the details of this vulnerability, please read\r\nsecurity advisory AST-2014-019, which was released at the same time as this\r\nannouncement.\r\n\r\nFor a full list of changes in the current releases, please see the ChangeLogs:\r\n\r\nhttp://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/certified-asterisk/releases/ChangeLog-11.6-cert9\r\nhttp://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/releases/ChangeLog-11.14.2\r\nhttp://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/releases/ChangeLog-12.7.2\r\nhttp://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/releases/ChangeLog-13.0.2\r\n\r\nThe security advisory is available at:\r\n\r\n * http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/security/AST-2014-019.pdf\nThe Asterisk Development Team has announced security releases for Certified\r\nAsterisk 11.6 and Asterisk 11, 12, and 13.
