When compiled with assertions enabled\r\n  (the default) they could previously cause Privoxy to abort().\r\n  Reported by Matthew Daley.\r\n  http://ijbswa.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/ijbswa/current/jcc.c?r1=1.433&r2=1.434\r\n\r\n- Fixed multiple segmentation faults and memory leaks in the\r\n  pcrs code. This fix also increases the chances that an invalid\r\n  pcrs command is rejected as such. Previously some invalid commands\r\n  would be loaded without error. Note that Privoxy's pcrs sources\r\n  (action and filter files) are considered trustworthy input and\r\n  should not be writable by untrusted third-parties.\r\n  http://ijbswa.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/ijbswa/current/pcrs.c?r1=1.46&r2=1.47\r\n\r\n- Fixed an 'invalid read' bug which could at least theoretically\r\n  cause Privoxy to crash.\r\n  http://ijbswa.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/ijbswa/current/parsers.c?r1=1.297&r2=1.298\r\n\r\n[1]: http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q1/259",
