						"thetext": "Description of problem:\n\nWe have a CentOS 6.5 VM with xfig-3.2.5-23.a.el6.x86_64 installed.  We have found that if you create a text area in a figure, typing a space character causes the user interface to freeze.\n\nThe VM still running.  You can log in with ssh and shut it down.\n\nThe cursor can be moved around but it remains an \"I-bar\" instead of an arrow.\n\nNone of the GNOME 2 panel functions can be used and Ctrl-Alt doesn't work.\n\nSending Ctrl-Alt-F2 from virt-viewer doesn't seem to do anything.\n\nI could not find any other character besides space which causes this problem.\n\n\nVersion-Release number of selected component (if applicable):\nspice-server-0.12.5-2.fc20.x86_64\nqemu-kvm-1.6.2-9.fc20.x86_64\nlibvirt-daemon-kvm-1.1.3.6-1.fc20.x86_64\nvirt-manager-1.0.1-4.fc20.noarch\n\n\nHow reproducible:\nHappens every time.\n\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Create a VM, install CentOS 6.5, run updates, install xfig, and login.\n2. Run xfig.\n3. Click on the Xfig toolbar button for Text entry.\n4. Click on the diagram to place a text field\n5. Press the space bar\n\n\nActual results:\nThe cursor in the text field disappears.  The mouse cursor remains an \"I-bar\" and you can't do anything else.\n\n\nExpected results:\nThe space should be entered in the text field and the UI should continue operating normally.\n\n\nAdditional info:\nThe same problem happens in RHEV 3 when connecting from remote-viewer and spice-html5.\n\nWe are using the virtual desktops to run electronics design software and Xfig is the IEEE standard for figures."

A more viable approach is for a Red Hat EL7 customer(s) to ask for a backport of Bug 1199446 to el-7.1.z.\n\n> \n> If I select SandyBridge as my current cluster type, can I upgrade it to\n> \"Haswell-noTSX\" once libvirt/qemu/ovirt supports it?\n\nYes, this is possible.\n\n> Does this require any\n> changes on the VM configuration? \n\nI don't think so.

A more viable approach is for a Red Hat EL7 customer(s) to ask for a backport of Bug 1199446 to el-7.1.z.\n\n> \n> If I select SandyBridge as my current cluster type, can I upgrade it to\n> \"Haswell-noTSX\" once libvirt/qemu/ovirt supports it?\n\nYes, this is possible.\n\n> Does this require any\n> changes on the VM configuration? \n\nI don't think so.
