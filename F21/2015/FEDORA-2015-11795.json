There are no known instances of this problem\n  being observed in the wild, but an exploit has been tested.\n\nDetails:\n========\n\n  Subversion FSFS repositories cache different types of data for performance\n  reasons.  An FSFS repository filesystem is structured as a direct acyclic\n  graph (DAG), and it has a special cache for the DAG nodes.  Subversion 1.8.0\n  added an additional level of caching for the DAG nodes, and the excessive\n  memory use is a consequence of the cached nodes not being deallocated in\n  a timely manner.\n\n  HTTPD Server and Subversion use memory pools for allocations.  Certain\n  REPORT requests can trigger a state when the cache keeps allocating new\n  elements from a pool, but the previously allocated elements are not being\n  deallocated.  This memory will be reclaimed eventually (once the request\n  finishes or when the cache leaves the inappropriate state), but multiple\n  parallel requests might ultimately exhaust all the available memory on the\n  server.\n\nSeverity:\n=========\n\n  CVSSv2 Base Score: 5.0\n  CVSSv2 Base Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P\n\n  We consider this to be a medium risk vulnerability.  Repositories which\n  allow for anonymous reads will be vulnerable without authentication.\n  Unfortunately, no special configuration is required and all mod_dav_svn\n  servers with FSFS repositories are vulnerable.  Apache HTTPD servers that\n  block potentially expensive requests via mod_dontdothat module have a\n  smaller attack surface, but are still vulnerable.\n\n  Actual memory consumption (per request) depends on the layout and size\n  of the particular repository, but is potentially unbounded.  The impact\n  of using this memory varies wildly based on operating system and httpd\n  configuration.  Some operating systems may kill off processes or crash\n  if too much memory is used.  The Apache HTTPD configuration option of\n  MaxRequestsPerChild may restart a process after a certain number of\n  requests and limit the impact of accidental exercise of this issue.\n  However, a determined attacker could repeat the requests and mitigate\n  any countermeasures.\n\nRecommendations:\n================\n\n  There is no effective configuration that can mitigate the issue entirely\n  however the use of ulimit (or the equivalent) to set memory limits for\n  processes may help prevent the impact affecting other services running on\n  the same machine.\n\nStatement:\n\nNot vulnerable. This issue did not affect the versions of subversion as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6 and 7 as they did not include support for additional level of caching for the DAG nodes, which cause excessive memory use due to the cached nodes not being deallocated in a timely manner.\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the Apache Software Foundation for reporting this issue.

Servers\n  using threaded MPMs will close the connection on other clients being\n  served by the same process that services the request from the attacker.\n  In either case there is an increased processing impact of restarting a\n  process and the cost of per process caches being lost.\n\n  Exploiting this behavior against svnserve does not require an attacker to\n  authenticate.  A remote attacker can cause svnserve process to terminate\n  and thus deny service to users of the server.\n\n  Unfortunately, no special configuration is required and all mod_dav_svn\n  and svnserve servers are vulnerable.\n\nRecommendations:\n================\n\n  No known workarounds are available.\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the Apache Software Foundation for reporting this issue.

This can be accomplished\n  using a specially crafted sequence of requests.  An evil-doer can fake\n  svn:author values on his commits.  However, as authorization rules are\n  applied to the evil-doer's true username, forged svn:author values can\n  only happen on commits that touch the paths the evil-doer has write\n  access to.\n\n  Doing so does not grant any additional access and does not circumvent the\n  standard Apache authentication or authorization mechanisms.  Still, an\n  ability to spoof svn:author property values can impact data integrity in\n  environments that rely on these values.\n\n  There are no known instances of the problem being exploited in the wild,\n  but an exploit has been tested.\n\nDetails:\n========\n\n  The Subversion http://-based protocol used for communicating with\n  a Subversion mod_dav_svn server has two versions, v1 and v2.  The v2\n  protocol was added in Subversion 1.7.0, but the server allows using both\n  protocol versions for compatibility reasons.  When a commit happens, the\n  client sends a sequence of requests (POST, PUT, MERGE, etc.) that depend\n  on the negotiated protocol version.\n\n  Usually, a server uses the name of the authenticated user as the svn:author\n  value for a new revision.  However, with a specially handcrafted v1 request\n  sequence, a client can instruct the server to use the svn:author property\n  that she/he provided.  In this case, the server will use an arbitrary value\n  coming from the client instead of the svn:author value originating from\n  the authentication mechanism.\n\nSeverity:\n=========\n\n  CVSSv2 Base Score: 3.5\n  CVSSv2 Base Vector: AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N\n\n  We consider this to be a medium risk vulnerability.\n\n  An attacker needs to have commit access to the repository to exploit the\n  vulnerability.  The ability to spoof svn:author property values can impact\n  data integrity in environments that expect the values to denote the actual\n  commit author.  The real ID of the author could still be determined using\n  server access logs.  However, it is also possible that a spoofed change\n  could go in unnoticed.\n\n  Subversion's repository hooks might see the real ID of the author or the\n  forged value, depending on the hook type and the hook contents:\n\n  - A start-commit hook will see the real username in the USER argument\n  - A start-commit hook will see the real username when performing\n    'svnlook propget --revprop -t TXN_NAME'\n  - A pre-commit hook will see the forged username when performing\n    'svnlook propget --revprop -t TXN_NAME'\n  - A post-commit hook will see the forged username when performing\n    'svnlook propget --revprop -r REV'\n\n  Unfortunately, no special configuration is required and all mod_dav_svn\n  servers are vulnerable.\n\nRecommendations:\n================\n\n  No workaround is available.\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the Apache Software Foundation for reporting this issue.

								"thetext": "Summary:\n========\n\n  Subversion's mod_dav_svn Apache HTTPD server module may use excessive\n  amounts of memory when processing REPORT requests that require traversing\n  through a large number of FSFS repository nodes (files and directories).\n\n  This can lead to a DoS.  There are no known instances of this problem\n  being observed in the wild, but an exploit has been tested.\n\nDetails:\n========\n\n  Subversion FSFS repositories cache different types of data for performance\n  reasons.  An FSFS repository filesystem is structured as a direct acyclic\n  graph (DAG), and it has a special cache for the DAG nodes.  Subversion 1.8.0\n  added an additional level of caching for the DAG nodes, and the excessive\n  memory use is a consequence of the cached nodes not being deallocated in\n  a timely manner.\n\n  HTTPD Server and Subversion use memory pools for allocations.  Certain\n  REPORT requests can trigger a state when the cache keeps allocating new\n  elements from a pool, but the previously allocated elements are not being\n  deallocated.  This memory will be reclaimed eventually (once the request\n  finishes or when the cache leaves the inappropriate state), but multiple\n  parallel requests might ultimately exhaust all the available memory on the\n  server.\n\nSeverity:\n=========\n\n  CVSSv2 Base Score: 5.0\n  CVSSv2 Base Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P\n\n  We consider this to be a medium risk vulnerability.  Repositories which\n  allow for anonymous reads will be vulnerable without authentication.\n  Unfortunately, no special configuration is required and all mod_dav_svn\n  servers with FSFS repositories are vulnerable.  Apache HTTPD servers that\n  block potentially expensive requests via mod_dontdothat module have a\n  smaller attack surface, but are still vulnerable.\n\n  Actual memory consumption (per request) depends on the layout and size\n  of the particular repository, but is potentially unbounded.  The impact\n  of using this memory varies wildly based on operating system and httpd\n  configuration.  Some operating systems may kill off processes or crash\n  if too much memory is used.  The Apache HTTPD configuration option of\n  MaxRequestsPerChild may restart a process after a certain number of\n  requests and limit the impact of accidental exercise of this issue.\n  However, a determined attacker could repeat the requests and mitigate\n  any countermeasures.\n\nRecommendations:\n================\n\n  There is no effective configuration that can mitigate the issue entirely\n  however the use of ulimit (or the equivalent) to set memory limits for\n  processes may help prevent the impact affecting other services running on\n  the same machine.\n\nStatement:\n\nNot vulnerable. This issue did not affect the versions of subversion as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6 and 7 as they did not include support for additional level of caching for the DAG nodes, which cause excessive memory use due to the cached nodes not being deallocated in a timely manner.\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the Apache Software Foundation for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Evgeny Kotkov of VisualSVN as the original reporter."

								"thetext": "Summary:\n========\n\n  Subversion's mod_dav_svn server allows setting arbitrary svn:author\n  property values when committing new revisions.  This can be accomplished\n  using a specially crafted sequence of requests.  An evil-doer can fake\n  svn:author values on his commits.  However, as authorization rules are\n  applied to the evil-doer's true username, forged svn:author values can\n  only happen on commits that touch the paths the evil-doer has write\n  access to.\n\n  Doing so does not grant any additional access and does not circumvent the\n  standard Apache authentication or authorization mechanisms.  Still, an\n  ability to spoof svn:author property values can impact data integrity in\n  environments that rely on these values.\n\n  There are no known instances of the problem being exploited in the wild,\n  but an exploit has been tested.\n\nDetails:\n========\n\n  The Subversion http://-based protocol used for communicating with\n  a Subversion mod_dav_svn server has two versions, v1 and v2.  The v2\n  protocol was added in Subversion 1.7.0, but the server allows using both\n  protocol versions for compatibility reasons.  When a commit happens, the\n  client sends a sequence of requests (POST, PUT, MERGE, etc.) that depend\n  on the negotiated protocol version.\n\n  Usually, a server uses the name of the authenticated user as the svn:author\n  value for a new revision.  However, with a specially handcrafted v1 request\n  sequence, a client can instruct the server to use the svn:author property\n  that she/he provided.  In this case, the server will use an arbitrary value\n  coming from the client instead of the svn:author value originating from\n  the authentication mechanism.\n\nSeverity:\n=========\n\n  CVSSv2 Base Score: 3.5\n  CVSSv2 Base Vector: AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N\n\n  We consider this to be a medium risk vulnerability.\n\n  An attacker needs to have commit access to the repository to exploit the\n  vulnerability.  The ability to spoof svn:author property values can impact\n  data integrity in environments that expect the values to denote the actual\n  commit author.  The real ID of the author could still be determined using\n  server access logs.  However, it is also possible that a spoofed change\n  could go in unnoticed.\n\n  Subversion's repository hooks might see the real ID of the author or the\n  forged value, depending on the hook type and the hook contents:\n\n  - A start-commit hook will see the real username in the USER argument\n  - A start-commit hook will see the real username when performing\n    'svnlook propget --revprop -t TXN_NAME'\n  - A pre-commit hook will see the forged username when performing\n    'svnlook propget --revprop -t TXN_NAME'\n  - A post-commit hook will see the forged username when performing\n    'svnlook propget --revprop -r REV'\n\n  Unfortunately, no special configuration is required and all mod_dav_svn\n  servers are vulnerable.\n\nRecommendations:\n================\n\n  No workaround is available.\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the Apache Software Foundation for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Evgeny Kotkov of VisualSVN as the original reporter."
