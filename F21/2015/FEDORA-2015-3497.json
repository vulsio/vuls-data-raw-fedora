It is still possible to enable use of MD4 for compatibility.\n\nhttps://github.com/librsync/librsync/blob/e2d3bdf/NEWS\n\nQuoting from the upstream NEWS file:\n\n * SECURITY: CVE-2014-8242: librsync previously used a truncated MD4\n   \"strong\" check sum to match blocks. However, MD4 is not cryptographically\n   strong. It's possible that an attacker who can control the contents of one\n   part of a file could use it to control other regions of the file, if it's\n   transferred using librsync/rdiff. For example this might occur in a\n   database, mailbox, or VM image containing some attacker-controlled data.\n\n   To mitigate this issue, signatures will by default be computed with a\n   256-bit BLAKE2 hash. Old versions of librsync will complain about a\n   bad magic number when given these signature files.\n\n   Backward compatibility can be obtained using the new\n   `rdiff sig --hash=md4`\n   option or through specifying the \"signature magic\" in the API, but \n   this should not be used when either the old or new file contain \n   untrusted data.\n\n   Deltas generated from those signatures will also use BLAKE2 during\n   generation, but produce output that can be read by old versions.\n\n   See https://github.com/librsync/librsync/issues/5\n\n   Thanks to Michael Samuel <miknet.net> for reporting this and offering an\n   initial patch."

However, MD4 is not cryptographically\n   strong. It's possible that an attacker who can control the contents of one\n   part of a file could use it to control other regions of the file, if it's\n   transferred using librsync/rdiff. For example this might occur in a\n   database, mailbox, or VM image containing some attacker-controlled data.\n\n   To mitigate this issue, signatures will by default be computed with a\n   256-bit BLAKE2 hash. Old versions of librsync will complain about a\n   bad magic number when given these signature files.\n\n   Backward compatibility can be obtained using the new\n   `rdiff sig --hash=md4`\n   option or through specifying the \"signature magic\" in the API, but \n   this should not be used when either the old or new file contain \n   untrusted data.\n\n   Deltas generated from those signatures will also use BLAKE2 during\n   generation, but produce output that can be read by old versions.\n\n   See https://github.com/librsync/librsync/issues/5\n\n   Thanks to Michael Samuel <miknet.net> for reporting this and offering an\n   initial patch."

	"notes": "Changes in librsync 1.0.0 (2015-01-23)\r\n======================================\r\n\r\n  * SECURITY: CVE-2014-8242: librsync previously used a truncated MD4 \"strong\" check sum to match blocks. However, MD4 is not cryptographically strong. It's possible that an attacker who can control the contents of one part of a file could use it to control other regions of the file, if it's transferred using librsync/rdiff. For example this might occur in a database, mailbox, or VM image containing some attacker-controlled data. To mitigate this issue, signatures will by default be computed with a 256-bit BLAKE2 hash. Old versions of librsync will complain about a bad magic number when given these signature files. Backward compatibility can be obtained using the new `rdiff sig --hash=md4` option or through specifying the \"signature magic\" in the API, but this should not be used when either the old or new file contain untrusted data. Deltas generated from those signatures will also use BLAKE2 during generation, but produce output that can be read by old versions. See https://github.com/librsync/librsync/issues/5. Thanks to Michael Samuel <miknet.net> for reporting this and offering an initial patch.\r\n  * Various build fixes, thanks Timothy Gu.\r\n  * Improved rdiff man page from Debian.\r\n  * Improved librsync.spec file for building RPMs.\r\n  * Fixed bug #1110812 'internal error: job made no progress'; on large files.\r\n  * Moved hosting to https://github.com/librsync/librsync/\r\n  * Travis-CI.org integration test at https://travis-ci.org/librsync/librsync/\r\n  * Remove bundled copy of popt; it must be installed separately.\r\n  * You can set `$LIBTOOLIZE` before running `autogen.sh`, for example on OS X Homebrew where it is called `glibtoolize`.",
