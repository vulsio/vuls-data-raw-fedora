Consider adding something like (copied from another package):\n\n# Use the same directory of the main package for subpackage licence and docs\n%global _docdir_fmt %{name}\n\nThis will avoid having a doc/usbip-devel directory with one file (or\nlicenses/usbip-devel directory with one file if you do 3.)\n\n4. Combine the two %systemd_posts into one, it'll reload systemd just once.\n\n5. /etc/default is an abomination. You can incorporate the file into the systemd service file\nas a comment. If somebody is doing debugging, they can create\n/run/systemd/system/usbip-server.d/override.conf with updates the options (by the\ntime F22 comes out, systemctl edit usbip-server will do this automatically).\n\n6. Module loading in a service file is very much discouraged. Is is not possible to have the module\nload automatically? And rmmod in a service file is usually a bad idea because rmmod can interfere with other\nthings. Why is this necessary?\n\n7.

If we move the module later then we have to adjust the Requires manually.  Just require the actual module since the kernel auto-generates provides for all .ko files.\n\n2) Why does this BuildRequire: systemd?\n\n3) Why doesn't it BuildRequire:automake (or whatever is used to generate configure) and libtool?\n\nThe more I look at this, the more I think it would be better to just split out the sources into their own SRPM and build the package entirely separate.  There's a lot of stuff here that is very userspace-ish.  The kernel maintainers aren't going to build this and ship it with the expectation that we'll actually be in a position to support it.  It would be better for it to have a proper maintainer on the userspace side."

The usbip tools were merged into mainline out of staging in the 3.17 kernel, as you mentioned.  Since 3.17 was released, there has been a grand total of 2 commits to that entire directory.  Neither one of those looks like it would actually impact anything other than the internal code organization.  It isn't what I'd call a high churn source base.  By having it in the kernel-tools package (or any other subpackage via the kernel SRPM) we wind up building the same package over and over again for no benefit."

On a related note, if I split userspace off into a separate SRPM, should I work from the full kernel source or should I pull the userspace out and tar it up (with full comments in the spec)?  I'm just not sure how reasonable it is to have a 77MB source for a <100KB package."

An example is\nfind_keyring_by_name() which would dereference key->user for a key that is\nin the process of being garbage collected (where key->user was freed but\n->destroy() wasn't called yet - so it's still present in the linked list).\n\n\"\"\"\n\nAn unprivileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system.\n\n[1] http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=141986398232547&w=2"
