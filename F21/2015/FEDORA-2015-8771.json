That prevents fusermount from running mount and umount (see mtab_needs_update() function).  Even though mount and umount in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 use libmount that supports reading LIBMOUNT_MTAB environment variable, they are not run by fusermount.  Similar applies to current Fedora versions.\n\nOn Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6, /etc/mtab is regular file and hence fusermount runs mount and umount commands.  However, mount and umount in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and earlier do not use libmount (on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, libmount is part of the util-linux-ng packages, but not used by mount and umount commands; on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, the util-linux packages do not contain libmount library).\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Hypervisor contains the libguestfs-winsupport packages, which includes ntfs-3g.  However, ntfs-3g is not installed as setuid root and hence there is no privilege escalation risk."
