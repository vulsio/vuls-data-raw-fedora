						"thetext": "As noted in comment 0 above, this issue does not affect the default OpenSSH sshd configuration in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, 6, and 7, because the default sshd_config (/etc/ssh/sshd_config) explicitly disables ChallengeResponseAuthentication using \"ChallengeResponseAuthentication no\".  Only configurations with \"ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes\" are affected by this issues.  Note that the lack of the ChallengeResponseAuthentication configuration directive in sshd_config does not imply that the ChallengeResponseAuthentication is disabled, as its default value is \"yes\".\n\nThis issue affects keyboard-interactive authentication method.  One simple way to check if a system may be affected by this issue is to connect to it using ssh client running in verbose mode and check if keyboard-interactive is listed among authentication methods that server offered.  For example, run:\n\n  $ ssh -v test@127.0.0.1\n\nIn the generated debug output, search for line as:\n\ndebug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic,password\n\nor\n\ndebug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic,password,keyboard-interactive\n\nIf the list does not include \"keyboard-interactive\", it is not affected by this issue because of its configuration.  Systems with keyboard-interactive method enabled may be affected.\n\nThe default PAM configuration also mitigates impact of this flaw, as pam_unix is configured to add 2 second delay after unsuccessful authentication.  This limits the number of password prompts displayed before LoginGraceTime (the default value is 120 seconds) is reached.  I.e. no more than 60 password guesses per connection should be expected rather than thousands mentioned in the report for FreeBSD.\n\nThis issue can be mitigated by disabling ChallengeResponseAuthentication in the sshd_config configuration file and restarting the sshd service.\n\nThe impact of this issue is limited to increasing efficiency of the brute-force password guessing attacks.\n\nGiven the limited impact on Red Hat Enterprise Linux and the fact that default configuration is not affected, this is not planned to be fixed immediately, but may be corrected in future OpenSSH updates in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7.  This issue is not planned to be corrected in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and earlier.\n\nMitigation:\n\nThis issue can be mitigated by disabling keyboard-interactive authentication method.  That can be achieved by setting \"ChallengeResponseAuthentication no\" in the /etc/ssh/sshd_config configuration file and restarting the sshd service.\n\nStatement:\n\nThis issue does not affect the default OpenSSH sshd configuration in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, 6 and 7."
