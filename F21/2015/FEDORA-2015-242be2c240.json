						"thetext": "A vulnerability allowing malicious geust to crash the host was found. Early versions of Xen on ARM did not support \"multicall\" functionality (the ability to perform multiple operations via a single hypercall) and therefore stubbed out the functionality needed to support preemption of multicalls in a manner which crashed the host. When multicall support was subsequently added these stubs were not replaced with the correct functionality and therefore exposed to guests a code path which crashes the host. Any guest can issue a preemptable hypercall via the multicall interface to exploit this vulnerability. Both 32- and 64-bit ARM systems are vulnerable from Xen 4.4 onward.\n\nMitigation:\n\nOn systems where the guest kernel is controlled by the host rather than guest administrator, running only kernels which do not make use of multicall functionality will prevent untrusted guest users from exploiting this issue. However untrusted guest administrators can still trigger it unless further steps are taken to prevent them from loading code into the kernel (e.g. by disabling loadable modules etc) or from using other mechanisms which allow them to run code at kernel privilege."

						"thetext": "This CVE also covers the same issue in XSA 151:\n\nISSUE DESCRIPTION\n=================\n\nA domain's xenoprofile state contains an array of per-vcpu\ninformation, which is allocated once in the lifetime of a domain in\nresponse to that domain using the XENOPROF_get_buffer hypercall on\nitself or by a domain with the privilege to profile a target domain\nusing the XENOPROF_set_passive hypercall.\n\nThis array is leaked on domain teardown.  This memory leak could --\nover time -- exhaust the host's memory.\n\nIMPACT\n======\n\nThe following parties can mount a denial of service attack affecting\nthe whole system:\n\n  - A malicious guest administrator via XENOPROF_get_buffer.\n  - A domain given suitable privilege over another domain\n    via XENOPROF_set_passive (this would usually be a domain being\n    used to profile another domain, eg with the xenoprof tool).\n\nThe ability to also restart or create suitable domains is also\nrequired to fully exploit the issue.  Without this the leak is limited\nto a small multiple of the maximum number of vcpus for the domain.\n\nThe maximum leak is 128kbytes per domain (re)boot.\n\nVULNERABLE SYSTEMS\n==================\n\nVersions of Xen from 4.0 onwards are vulnerable.\n\nThe XENOPROF hypercalls are only implemented on x86.  ARM is therefore\nnot vulnerable.\n\nMITIGATION\n==========\n\nOn systems where the guest kernel is controlled by the host rather\nthan guest administrator, running only kernels (in the target and\nprofiling domain respectively) which do not call these hypercalls will\nalso prevent untrusted guest users from exploiting this issue. However\nuntrusted guest administrators can still trigger it unless further\nsteps are taken to prevent them from loading code into the kernel\n(e.g. by disabling loadable modules etc) or from using other\nmechanisms which allow them to run code at kernel privilege.\n\nThe leak is small.  Preventing the creation of large numbers of new\ndomains, and limiting the number of times an existing domain can be\nrebooted, can reduce the impact of this vulnerability.\n\nNOTE REGARDING CVE\n==================\n\nNote that CVE-2015-7969 covers both this issue and XSA-149."

						"thetext": "When running an HVM domain in Populate-on-Demand mode, Xen would sometimes search the domain for memory to reclaim, in response to demands for population of other pages in the same domain. This search runs without preemption. The guest can, by suitable arrangement of its memory contents, create a situation where this search is a time-consuming linear scan of the guest's address space. The scan might be triggered by the guest's own actions, or by toolstack operations such as migration.\n\nA malicious administrator of a suitable guest can cause a denial of service. Specifically, such a guest can prevent use of a physical CPU for a significant period. If the host watchdog is in use, this can lead to a watchdog timeout and consequently a host reboot (for example).\n\nThe vulnerability is exposed to any HVM guest which has been constructed in Populate-on-Demand mode (ie, with memory < maxmem). Such a configuration is usual when the host administrator intends to oversubscribe system RAM. ARM is not vulnerable. x86 PV VMs are not vulnerable. x86 HVM domains without PoD (ie started with memory==maxmem) are not vulnerable.\n\nMitigation:\n\nRunning only PV guests will avoid this issue. Running HVM guest without enabling Populate-on-Demand mode (so, ensuring that maxmem==memory) will avoid this issue."

This memory leak could --\nover time -- exhaust the host's memory.\n\nIMPACT\n======\n\nThe following parties can mount a denial of service attack affecting\nthe whole system:\n\n  - A malicious guest administrator via XENOPROF_get_buffer.\n  - A domain given suitable privilege over another domain\n    via XENOPROF_set_passive (this would usually be a domain being\n    used to profile another domain, eg with the xenoprof tool).\n\nThe ability to also restart or create suitable domains is also\nrequired to fully exploit the issue.  Without this the leak is limited\nto a small multiple of the maximum number of vcpus for the domain.\n\nThe maximum leak is 128kbytes per domain (re)boot.\n\nVULNERABLE SYSTEMS\n==================\n\nVersions of Xen from 4.0 onwards are vulnerable.\n\nThe XENOPROF hypercalls are only implemented on x86.  ARM is therefore\nnot vulnerable.\n\nMITIGATION\n==========\n\nOn systems where the guest kernel is controlled by the host rather\nthan guest administrator, running only kernels (in the target and\nprofiling domain respectively) which do not call these hypercalls will\nalso prevent untrusted guest users from exploiting this issue. However\nuntrusted guest administrators can still trigger it unless further\nsteps are taken to prevent them from loading code into the kernel\n(e.g. by disabling loadable modules etc) or from using other\nmechanisms which allow them to run code at kernel privilege.\n\nThe leak is small.  Preventing the creation of large numbers of new\ndomains, and limiting the number of times an existing domain can be\nrebooted, can reduce the impact of this vulnerability.\n\nNOTE REGARDING CVE\n==================\n\nNote that CVE-2015-7969 covers both this issue and XSA-149."

These log messages are not rate-limited, even though they can be triggered by guests.\n\nA malicious guest could cause repeated logging to the hypervisor console, leading to a Denial of Service attack.\n\nXen versions 3.2.x and later are affected. (The VPMU part of the vulnerability is applicable only to Xen 4.6 and later.) ARM systems are not affected. (The pmu hypercall is x86-specific, and xenoprof is not supported on ARM.)\n\nMitigation:\n\nThe problematic log messages are issued with priority Warning. Therefore they can be rate limited by adding \"loglvl=error/warning\" to the hypervisor command line or suppressed entirely by adding \"loglvl=error\". On systems where the guest kernel is controlled by the host rather than guest administrator, running only kernels which do not call these hypercalls will also prevent untrusted guest users from exploiting this issue. However untrusted guest administrators can still trigger it unless further steps are taken to prevent them from loading code into the kernel (e.g. by disabling loadable modules etc) or from using other mechanisms which allow them to run code at kernel privilege."

								"thetext": "When running an HVM domain in Populate-on-Demand mode, Xen would sometimes search the domain for memory to reclaim, in response to demands for population of other pages in the same domain. This search runs without preemption. The guest can, by suitable arrangement of its memory contents, create a situation where this search is a time-consuming linear scan of the guest's address space. The scan might be triggered by the guest's own actions, or by toolstack operations such as migration.\n\nA malicious administrator of a suitable guest can cause a denial of service. Specifically, such a guest can prevent use of a physical CPU for a significant period. If the host watchdog is in use, this can lead to a watchdog timeout and consequently a host reboot (for example).\n\nThe vulnerability is exposed to any HVM guest which has been constructed in Populate-on-Demand mode (ie, with memory < maxmem). Such a configuration is usual when the host administrator intends to oversubscribe system RAM. ARM is not vulnerable. x86 PV VMs are not vulnerable. x86 HVM domains without PoD (ie started with memory==maxmem) are not vulnerable.\n\nMitigation:\n\nRunning only PV guests will avoid this issue. Running HVM guest without enabling Populate-on-Demand mode (so, ensuring that maxmem==memory) will avoid this issue."
