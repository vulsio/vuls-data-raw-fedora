The configuration can be tweaked to prevent users from attaching coredumps to bugzilla during the standard reporting process.\n\n1.) remove coredump from the list of attachable items\n$ sed 's/<exclude-items-by-default>coredump,/<exclude-items-by-default>/' -i /etc/libreport/events/report_Bugzilla.xml\n\n2.) add coredump to the list of forbidden items\n$ sed 's/<exclude-items-always\\/>/<exclude-items-always>coredump<\\/exclude-items-always>/' -i /etc/libreport/events/report_Bugzilla.xml\n\n\n\nThere is no possibility to prevent users from enabling the automatic bug reporting. In the default configuration the automatic bug reporting sends a micro-report to ABRT server. The micro-report is a simplified backtrace without any private and security sensitive data. Therefore, no one has ever expected that someone will consider it problematic.\n\nYou can set AutoreportingEvent option in /etc/abrt/abrt.conf to non-existing event (or better to a dummy event which does nothing) to make the automatic bug reporting functionless but the user can override this configuration in his configuration file.\n\n\n\nThe 'No' response must not be saved because it would completely disable the bug reporting."

I'm sure I'll be able to persuade the IT Security folks to allow me to leave abrt enabled, with this.\n\nIt's OK for users to access coredumps on their own machines; we just didn't want them getting *uploaded* to non-$COMPANY machines.\n\nI'm still a little confused about why the 'no' response about using the *retrace* server can't be saved. If I press 'no', it downloads debuginfo packages and generates the backtrace locally. Couldn't it just do that every time?\n\nBut that isn't important since you seem to have told me how to remove the external retrace server, so the question doesn't even get *asked*. That's the equivalent of saving the 'no' answer, unless I'm misunderstanding something."

Knowing it was EPERM and ENOENT would have helped here without having to smatter debug into the tool.  Just providing the cpio stdout and stderr in the case of failure would likely be enough for most sysadmins to go figure out what the problem is."

The application must always be able to recover from manual deletion of these files (generally because of a disk space shortage).\"\n\nBut /var/cache/abrt-di/ is created by the installation of the abrt-addon-ccpp-2.3.0-4.fc21.x86_64 RPM.\n\nWhen I'm trying to report the control-center crash, I'm running as user beland, so I can see why abrt is having trouble recovering, as /var/cache is owned by root.  It would be nice if abrt could recover more gracefully from this situation, either by asking for an administrator password so it can recreate the directory, putting its downloaded data somewhere it *can* access, or at least giving a clearer error message.\n\nAfter doing:\n\nsudo mkdir /var/cache/abrt-di/\nsudo chown -R abrt.abrt /var/cache/abrt-di/\n\nI was able to report Bug 1219606 normally."

We have almost ready patches fixing the exploit but the fix is rather a work around, because it requires moving the abrt problem directories from the system directory (/var/tmp/abrt) to user home directories which makes the reporting process less comfortable and has a pair of side effects (e.g. breaks the local duplicate detection). So, the first step described in the bug description should be done in a week. The proper fix (the second step) needs more time and can done in a regular update."
