Currently - when RADIUS authentication is in place for xauth requests the \"access-request\" message is generated without \"Calling-Station-Id\" attribute. \nIn general this attribute is used for sending client origin IP address toward RADIUS server for loggining purposes within RADIUS authentication requests. \n\n\nVersion-Release number of selected component (if applicable):\nipsec-tools-0.8.0\n\nAttaching patch provides \"Calling-Station-Id\" functionality for current version of ipsec-tools for both IPv4 and IPv6 versions as well. \n\nPlease consider this patch as it can be very useful. \nThis patch has been already discussed within [Ipsec-tools-devel] maillist under subject \"Calling-Station-Id as attribute when radius authentication is in place\" and it will be included in last upstream git version of ipsec-tools by maintainer.\n\nmany thanks in advance."

						"thetext": "Description of problem:\n\nThe ipsec-tools 0.8.1 release contains a bug where the initiator will call out using source port 4500 to destination port 500.  The responder will then respond from 500 to 4500 but the initiator will not accept the response, presumably because it is not expecting NAT-T (port 4500) packets.\n\nSimply changing the existing spec version to 0.8.2, grabbing the upstream source tarball, and rebuilding and upgrading fixes the problem immediately.\n\nVersion-Release number of selected component (if applicable):\n\nipsec-tools-0.8.1-2.fc20.i686\n\nHow reproducible:\n\nAlways\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Set up two Fedora 20 hosts\n2. Configure racoon.conf with remote blocks on each host for isakmp, it is not necessary to define any tunnels.\n3. Attempt to initiate from one host to the other using racoonctl establish-sa isakmp inet {src} {dst}\n\nTo see racoon's state: racoonctl -l show-sa isakmp\nFor more info: tcpdump -n -p -i eth0 -s0 -vv udp port 500 or udp port 4500\n\nActual results:\n\nAs discussed in the description, the initiator will use port 4500 as the source port of packets but will ignore the responder's replies sent back to 4500.  The responder will typically try multiple times.\n\nExpected results:\n\nThe isakmp (phase1) negotiation should complete almost immediately.  Only port 500 should be used, particularly if nat_traversal off in the racoon.conf.\n\nAdditional info:\n\nSo long as the initiator is upgraded (or downgraded to a version without the bug, e.g. some other distribution like MikroTik) the tunnel can at least be established.  It also appears that there may be some magic where some responders will switch to initiator mode and so long as they don't have the bug the tunnel will be established (albeit more slowly than it could have been).\n\nThis leads to an odd situation where Fedora <-> Fedora tunnels don't work, but tunnels to other products work just fine."
