To be exploitable, an attacker would require the ability to modify ciphertext either at rest or in transit.\n\nBecause a MAC bypass is possible, authenticity of the ciphertext cannot be guaranteed with the default ESAPI configuration. Consequently, this exposure may allow a successful padding oracle attack against the default ESAPI cryptosystem configuration and hence result in an exploitable vulnerability that could result in a loss of confidentiality or a bypass of the authentication or authorization system.\n\nThe issue is reported to be fixed in the 2.1.0 upstream release."

If you would still like \nto see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version \nof Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora \nversion prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.\n\nAlthough we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's \nlifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a \nmore recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes \nbugs or makes them obsolete."
