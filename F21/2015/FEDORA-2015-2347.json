Further uses of this handle will\nresult in use-after-free and double-free memory access violations.\nlibgssrpc server applications such as kadmind are vulnerable as they\ncan be instructed to call gss_process_context_token().\n\nThe krb5 mechanism implementation of gss_process_context_token(), upon\nsuccessfully validating a deletion token, frees the security context\nstructure.  This behavior is incorrect as the API has no way to alert\nthe caller that the security context was deleted.  The application is\nleft with a valid pointer to a mechglue security context structure,\ncontaining a dangling pointer to a freed krb5 security context\nstructure.

XDR data is\nserialized, deserialized, and freed using an application function,\noften generated by the rpcgen command.  If an application receives\nincorrectly serialized data from the client, the XDR function will\nreturn false to report a deserialization failure, perhaps leaving\nbehind partial deserialization results.

If the AUTH_GSSAPI authentication flavor is used, the\ncleanup is also erroneously performed by the internal unwrap function,\nso the XDR function is invoked twice to clean up the partial results.\n\nXDR functions can be defensive about being invoked twice for cleanup\nby assigning pointer values to NULL after freeing them.  Most XDR\nfunctions do this, but the XDR functions within libkadm5 for principal\nnames and tag-length data do not.

						"thetext": "Upstream reports that libgssrpc applications including kadmind output four or\neight bytes of uninitialized memory to the network as part of an\nunused \"handle\" field in replies to clients.\n\nAn attacker could attempt to glean sensitive\ninformation from the four or eight bytes of uninitialized data output\nby kadmind or other libgssrpc server application.  Because MIT krb5\ngenerally sanitizes memory containing krb5 keys before freeing it, it\nis unlikely that kadmind would leak Kerberos key information, but it\nis not impossible.\n\nRFC 2203 defines structures for the RPCSEC_GSS authentication flavor.\nThe rpc_gss_init_res structure which conveys responses to the client\ncontains an opaque \"handle\" field which is supposed to be used to\nidentify the GSS-API security context.  The client mirrors this field\nback to the server in the \"handle\" field of rpc_gss_cred_vers_1_t in\nsubsequent requests.\n\nThe MIT krb5 implementation of RPCSEC_GSS does not use the handle to\nfind the GSS-API context, but it still provides a handle value to the\nclient.  To provide this value, it copies the first eight or sixteen\nbytes out of the GSS-API security context handle.  (The number of\nbytes depends on the platform's pointer size; it is eight bytes on a\n32-bit platform and sixteen bytes on a 64-bit platform.)\n\nIn release krb5-1.11, an unused \"interposer\" field was added to the\nmechglue GSS security context structure as the second pointer field.\nBecause this field is unused, it remains uninitialized, so the second\nhalf of the bytes copied from the GSS security context handle are\nuninitialized.\n\nThe contents of the uninitialized bytes could contain any heap data\npreviously freed by the application or any library it uses.  The MIT\nKerberos libraries and kadmind are generally careful to zero out\nsensitive data such as Kerberos key data before freeing it, but there\nis nevertheless a risk of leakage of a small amount of sensitive data\nto the network.\n\nSuggested patch to fix this issue, as well as CVE-2014-5352, CVE-2014-9421\nand CVE-2014-9422 is attached to https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1179856"

Because MIT krb5\ngenerally sanitizes memory containing krb5 keys before freeing it, it\nis unlikely that kadmind would leak Kerberos key information, but it\nis not impossible.\n\nRFC 2203 defines structures for the RPCSEC_GSS authentication flavor.\nThe rpc_gss_init_res structure which conveys responses to the client\ncontains an opaque \"handle\" field which is supposed to be used to\nidentify the GSS-API security context.  The client mirrors this field\nback to the server in the \"handle\" field of rpc_gss_cred_vers_1_t in\nsubsequent requests.\n\nThe MIT krb5 implementation of RPCSEC_GSS does not use the handle to\nfind the GSS-API context, but it still provides a handle value to the\nclient.  To provide this value, it copies the first eight or sixteen\nbytes out of the GSS-API security context handle.  (The number of\nbytes depends on the platform's pointer size; it is eight bytes on a\n32-bit platform and sixteen bytes on a 64-bit platform.)\n\nIn release krb5-1.11, an unused \"interposer\" field was added to the\nmechglue GSS security context structure as the second pointer field.\nBecause this field is unused, it remains uninitialized, so the second\nhalf of the bytes copied from the GSS security context handle are\nuninitialized.\n\nThe contents of the uninitialized bytes could contain any heap data\npreviously freed by the application or any library it uses.  The MIT\nKerberos libraries and kadmind are generally careful to zero out\nsensitive data such as Kerberos key data before freeing it, but there\nis nevertheless a risk of leakage of a small amount of sensitive data\nto the network.\n\nSuggested patch to fix this issue, as well as CVE-2014-5352, CVE-2014-9421\nand CVE-2014-9422 is attached to https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1179856"
