Or use xinetd to redirect traffic of your privileged ports to tomcat's unprivileged.\n\nWe can create tomcat-nginx and/or tomcat-httpd subpackages with tomcat frontend vhosts for nginx and/or httpd if you think it would be helpful.\n\nI think using frontend server is generally the best solution, much better then using jsvc.

Tomcat may read next request from the malformed chunked request body, rather than aborting connection as soon as the first encoding issue is detected.\n\nUpstream does not indicate where this may have practical impact, as Tomcat accepts multiple requests pipelined in a single connection.  It seems this may have impact in deployments where Tomcat is accessed via a reverse proxy that only exposes certain paths / web applications.  This may possibly allow bypass of proxy restrictions and allow access to URLs not exposed by the proxy.  However, this attack would require proxy to allow malformed requests to be passed to Tomcat."

Tomcat may read next request from the malformed chunked request body, rather than aborting connection as soon as the first encoding issue is detected.\n\nUpstream does not indicate where this may have practical impact, as Tomcat accepts multiple requests pipelined in a single connection.  It seems this may have impact in deployments where Tomcat is accessed via a reverse proxy that only exposes certain paths / web applications.  This may possibly allow bypass of proxy restrictions and allow access to URLs not exposed by the proxy.  However, this attack would require proxy to allow malformed requests to be passed to Tomcat."
