AFAIS, xmms-flac's sources are part of the flac tarball\n> and xmms-flac can be packaged as a subpackage of flac.without introducing\n> any run-time dep between xmms and flac.\n\nI believe an xmms plugin (like xmms-flac) needs to be compiled against xmms libraries (http://www.xmms.org/docs/vis-plugin.html) when installed it then goes into the xmms directory tree.\n\nSo now the flac maintainer would have to also worry about compiling it against xmms for this plugin.  Additionally if a user install flac (with xmms-flac plugin built in) the plugin needs to be installed into the xmms directory tree even though xmms isn't installed (creating that new path and having it associated with flac instead of xmms).  \n\nIf xmms want's flac support it makes more sense for xmms to worry about handling the plugin (either built in or as a separate package to solve possible install dep issues)\n\nI haven't had a chance to look at this particular rpm's file delivery structure so maybe they are doing something different.  I'll try and do that soon, but still makes more sense for xmms to be responsible for wanting to have flac support."

I was just presenting a possible reason why it shouldn't be in the flac tarball.\n\nIn the end, what I care about is getting the security issue patched and if moving it into flac proper is what people are willing to do, do it.\n\nAnd yes, now that I've hit my third ping on this let's take this to non-responsive.
