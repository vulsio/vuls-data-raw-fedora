With packet spanning multiple TMDs it can happen that the overall packet size will be bigger than sizeof(buffer), which results in memory corruption.\n\nA privileged guest user in a guest with AMD PCNet ethernet card enabled could potentially use this flaw to execute arbitrary code on the host with the privileges of the hosting QEMU process.\n\nUpstream fix:\n-------------\n  -> git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commit;h=9f7c594c006289ad41169b854d70f5da6e400a2a\n\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Matt Tait of Google's Project Zero security team for reporting this issue."
