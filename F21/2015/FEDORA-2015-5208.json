						"thetext": "ISSUE DESCRIPTION\n=================\n\nThe XEN_DOMCTL_memory_mapping hypercall allows long running operations\nwithout implementing preemption.\n\nThis hypercall is used by the device model as part of the emulation\nassociated with configuration of PCI devices passed through to HVM\nguests and is therefore indirectly exposed to those guests.\n\nThis can cause a physical CPU to become busy for a significant period,\nleading to a host denial of service in some cases.\n\nIf a host denial of service is not triggered then it may instead be\npossible to deny service to the domain running the device model,\ne.g. domain 0.\n\nThis hypercall is also exposed more generally to all\ntoolstacks. However the uses of it in libxl based toolstacks are not\nbelieved to open up any avenue of attack from an untrusted\nguest. Other toolstacks may be vulnerable however.\n\nIMPACT\n======\n\nThe vulnerability is exposed via HVM guests which have a PCI device\nassigned to them. A malicious HVM guest in such a configuration can\nmount a denial of service attack affecting the whole system via its\nassociated device model (qemu-dm).\n\nA guest is able to trigger this hypercall via operations which it is\nlegitimately expected to perform, therefore running the device model\nas a stub domain does not offer protection against the host denial of\nservice issue. However it does offer some protection against secondary\nissues such as denial of service against dom0.\n\nVULNERABLE SYSTEMS\n==================\n\nThe issue is exposed via x86 HVM VMs which have been assigned a PCI\ndevice.\n\nx86 PV domains, x86 HVM domains without passthrough devices and ARM\ndomains do not expose this vulnerability.\n\nXen 3.2.x and later are vulnerable.\nXen 3.1.x and earlier have not been inspected.\n\nMITIGATION\n==========\n\nRunning only PV guests will avoid this issue.\n\nThis issue can be avoided by not assigning devices with large MMIO\nregions to untrusted HVM guests.\n\nRESOLUTION\n==========\n\nApplying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue."

Subsequently some of them\ngot declared disaggregation safe, but for a small subset this was not\nreally correct: Their (mis-)use may result in host lockups.\n\nAs a result, the potential security benefits of toolstack\ndisaggregation are not always fully realised.\n\nIMPACT\n======\n\nDomains deliberately given partial management control may be able to\ndeny service to the entire host.\n\nAs a result, in a system designed to enhance security by radically\ndisaggregating the management, the security may be reduced. But, the\nsecurity will be no worse than a non-disaggregated design.\n\nVULNERABLE SYSTEMS\n==================\n\nXen versions 4.3 onwards are vulnerable.\nXen versions 4.2 and earlier do not have the described disaggregation\nfunctionality and hence are not vulnerable.\n\nMITIGATION\n==========\n\nThe issues discussed in this advisory are themselves bugs in features\nused for a security risk mitigation.\n\nThere is no further mitigation available, beyond general measures to\ntry to avoid parts of the system management becoming controlled by\nattackers. Those are the kind of measures which we expect any users\nof radical disaggregation to have already deployed.\n\nSwitching from disaggregated to a non-disaggregated operation does NOT\nmitigate these vulnerabilities. Rather, it simply recategorises the\nvulnerability to hostile management code, regarding it \"as designed\";\nthus it merely reclassifies these issues as \"not a bug\".\n\nUsers and vendors of disaggregated systems should not change their\nconfiguration. The robustness benefits of disaggregation are\nunaffected, and (depending on system design) security benefits are\nlikely to remain despite the vulnerabilities.\n\nRESOLUTION\n==========\n\nApplying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue."

								"thetext": "ISSUE DESCRIPTION\n=================\n\nXSA-77 put the majority of the domctl operations on a list excepting\nthem from having security advisories issued for them if any effects\ntheir use might have could hamper security. Subsequently some of them\ngot declared disaggregation safe, but for a small subset this was not\nreally correct: Their (mis-)use may result in host lockups.\n\nAs a result, the potential security benefits of toolstack\ndisaggregation are not always fully realised.\n\nIMPACT\n======\n\nDomains deliberately given partial management control may be able to\ndeny service to the entire host.\n\nAs a result, in a system designed to enhance security by radically\ndisaggregating the management, the security may be reduced. But, the\nsecurity will be no worse than a non-disaggregated design.\n\nVULNERABLE SYSTEMS\n==================\n\nXen versions 4.3 onwards are vulnerable.\nXen versions 4.2 and earlier do not have the described disaggregation\nfunctionality and hence are not vulnerable.\n\nMITIGATION\n==========\n\nThe issues discussed in this advisory are themselves bugs in features\nused for a security risk mitigation.\n\nThere is no further mitigation available, beyond general measures to\ntry to avoid parts of the system management becoming controlled by\nattackers. Those are the kind of measures which we expect any users\nof radical disaggregation to have already deployed.\n\nSwitching from disaggregated to a non-disaggregated operation does NOT\nmitigate these vulnerabilities. Rather, it simply recategorises the\nvulnerability to hostile management code, regarding it \"as designed\";\nthus it merely reclassifies these issues as \"not a bug\".\n\nUsers and vendors of disaggregated systems should not change their\nconfiguration. The robustness benefits of disaggregation are\nunaffected, and (depending on system design) security benefits are\nlikely to remain despite the vulnerabilities.\n\nRESOLUTION\n==========\n\nApplying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue."

However the uses of it in libxl based toolstacks are not\nbelieved to open up any avenue of attack from an untrusted\nguest. Other toolstacks may be vulnerable however.\n\nIMPACT\n======\n\nThe vulnerability is exposed via HVM guests which have a PCI device\nassigned to them. A malicious HVM guest in such a configuration can\nmount a denial of service attack affecting the whole system via its\nassociated device model (qemu-dm).\n\nA guest is able to trigger this hypercall via operations which it is\nlegitimately expected to perform, therefore running the device model\nas a stub domain does not offer protection against the host denial of\nservice issue. However it does offer some protection against secondary\nissues such as denial of service against dom0.\n\nVULNERABLE SYSTEMS\n==================\n\nThe issue is exposed via x86 HVM VMs which have been assigned a PCI\ndevice.\n\nx86 PV domains, x86 HVM domains without passthrough devices and ARM\ndomains do not expose this vulnerability.\n\nXen 3.2.x and later are vulnerable.\nXen 3.1.x and earlier have not been inspected.\n\nMITIGATION\n==========\n\nRunning only PV guests will avoid this issue.\n\nThis issue can be avoided by not assigning devices with large MMIO\nregions to untrusted HVM guests.\n\nRESOLUTION\n==========\n\nApplying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue."
