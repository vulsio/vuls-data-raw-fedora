As this data structure is located in writable memory it can be overwritten by garbage, which is sometimes the case [1].\n\nSince version 3.7 (commit 2aa362c49), Linux kernel adds NT_FILE note to core files which contains the files mapped by the process, including shared libraries.\n\nWould it make sense to try to detect in dwfl_core_file_report if the link_map chain is broken and fall back on NT_FILE in this case?\n\nI'm aware we can save the /proc/PID/maps file and call dwfl_linux_proc_maps_report on it, however it does not report the VDSO segment to elfutils as is the case with dwfl_core_file_report.\n\n[1] https://github.com/abrt/satyr/issues/127#issuecomment-46957546"

This works even for core files thanks to the first ELF page being dumped, build-id present and /usr/lib/debug/.build-id/ links present.\n\nIsn't the problem that AFAIK ABRT does not provide /usr/lib/debug/.build-id/ with all the links expected there?\n\n(I admit I haven't tried to reproduce it now, there may be some bugs.)\n\nThe possible disadvantage is that elfutils may have false positives - mapping more libraries than those really dlopen()ed.  For example a library mmap()ed as a data file for tools-kind application.  But for the unwinding purposes false positives should not matter."

While after the revert corrupted link_map breaks the elfutils-backtrace and after applying the NT_FILE elfutils above it the elfutils-backtrace with corrupted link_map could be working again.\n\n(Feel free to IRC me if it is not fully clear.)\n\nIf you do not have such testcase at hand that is sure also OK."
