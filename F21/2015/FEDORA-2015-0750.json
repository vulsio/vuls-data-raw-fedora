In the end, I found the section of code where they diverge, which is at bfd/format.c between from line 337 - 382.\n\nSo I was staring at the comment:\n\n\t      /* If this is the default target, accept it, even if\n\t\t other targets might match.  People who want those\n\t\t other targets have to set the GNUTARGET variable.  */\n\nwhich indeed gives me the answer I needed. gcc-nm/gcc-ar needs to have GNUTARGET=elf32-i386 set in the environment (or have \"--target elf32-i386\" specified) when building 32-bit archives on 64-bit platform, otherwise it would segfault. Still I would rather it would do that automatically, but at least this is a workaround...\n\nI 'll change the summary in my bug (https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1174065) accordingly."

This leak is detected by the covscan tool.\n\nWhat can happen is that a buffer of 8192 bytes is allocated but not freed.  This only happens when an illegal archive is being processed, and in this case the program will exit very shortly afterwards.  So the resource will not prevent the proper functioning of the program on valid archives, and it will not prevent the program from reporting and exiting (cleanly) on invalid archives.\n\nSince this problem has been detected so late in the 7.2 release process, a fix for it is being delayed until 7.3.  The update to fix the patch is uploaded here.\n\nCheers\n  Nick"
