Then you should get back the acpi_video# entries under /sys/class/backlight, and hopefully that will also fix the backlight control.\n\nAlso please do:\n\nsudo dmidecode > dmi.log\n\nAnd attach dmi.log here. Please let me know if the kernel commandline parameter works for you, if it does then I'll add your laptop model to the kernel quirks table containing models which need \"video.use_native_backlight=0\" so that future kernels will do the right thing automatically.\n\nRegards,\n\nHans"

Please test this kernel update (or newer) and let us know if you issue has been resolved or if it is still present with the newer kernel.\n\nIf you have moved on to Fedora 21, and are still experiencing this issue, please change the version to Fedora 21.\n\nIf you experience different issues, please open a new bug report for those."

If F20, there was a horizontal percentage bar that would show for a few seconds while changing the brightness; that's gone now and no brightness indication is shown while adjusting.  If you could tell me whether that's part of this bug or not, that'd be helpful.  But, asside from the indicator bar, the backlight adjustment *does work* with the aforementioned workaround, and doesn't work without the workaround."

I was afraid another drive I have (Crucial SSD with SATA-USB 3.0 interface with UAS support) would not work at max speed with this workaround but it still works at nice 400MB/s transfer speeds. So thank you for providing a solution! :)\n\nAs I said before, this iomega drive worked fine in Fedora 19 so it's strange how this \"regression\" ocurred... any chance this is somehow patched in the kernel so this drive does not need kernel commands at boot time?\n\nFor the record I will attach the system log that says:\n\nusb-storage 2-1:1.0: Quirks match for vid 059b pid 0070: 800000\n\nThanks,\nDavid"
