I guess it's best to just assume the worst case and fix it. meta_dc_restore() frees polyrect.TL and polyrect.BR but then ends up calling FR->region_clip() on it. Fix should be relatively straight-forward, I think.\n\n> https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=784205\nThis one seems harmless to me. Valgrind did not catch the OOB read on 64bit; it's visible on 32bit, though.\n\n>while (objects[i].type && (i < NUM_OBJECTS (API))) i++;\nshould really be\n>while ((i < NUM_OBJECTS (API)) && objects[i].type) i++;\nso that we don't access objects[i] if i is already OOB.\n\nThere are multiple similar checks throughout the code, e.g. see https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=784205;att=1;filename=fuzz1.patch;msg=5"
