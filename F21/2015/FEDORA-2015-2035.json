This over-read is long - it will trigger crash on 32bit systems, and is likely to trigger crash on 64bit systems as well.  As values read from the buffer are used to compute CRC value and are not copied to some other buffer, this does not corrupt memory, and hence does not have code execution impact.\n\nAffected code is only reached when running unzip in the test mode (unzip -t), but not when extracting zip archives."

If a zip file indicated that uncompressed data size was 0, unzip skipped the check to ensure that there were still enough data in the current extra field block to hold compression data header.  When using STORE compression (i.e. data stored uncompressed), this led to integer underflow, resulting in memcpy() getting called with excessively large size argument, causing it to over-read and over-write input and output buffers and crash.  This is unlikely to allow code execution.\n\nAffected code is only reached when running unzip in the test mode (unzip -t), but not when extracting zip archives."

This leads to crc32() function called with length argument close to 2^32 (regardless of the system architecture), and leads to buffer over-read.  This over-read is long - it will trigger crash on 32bit systems, and is likely to trigger crash on 64bit systems as well.  As values read from the buffer are used to compute CRC value and are not copied to some other buffer, this does not corrupt memory, and hence does not have code execution impact.\n\nAffected code is only reached when running unzip in the test mode (unzip -t), but not when extracting zip archives."

If a zip file indicated that uncompressed data size was 0, unzip skipped the check to ensure that there were still enough data in the current extra field block to hold compression data header.  When using STORE compression (i.e. data stored uncompressed), this led to integer underflow, resulting in memcpy() getting called with excessively large size argument, causing it to over-read and over-write input and output buffers and crash.  This is unlikely to allow code execution.\n\nAffected code is only reached when running unzip in the test mode (unzip -t), but not when extracting zip archives."

Referenced beta versions are available here:\n\nhttp://antinode.info/ftp/info-zip/\n\nThis problem was about insufficiently sized cfactorstr[] stack-based buffer, which could be overflown when large cfactor value is printed to it using:\n\nsprintf(cfactorstr, LoadFarString(CompFactorStr), sgn, cfactor);\n\nwhere CompFactorStr format string is:\n\n   static ZCONST char Far CompFactorStr[] = \"%c%d%%\";"
