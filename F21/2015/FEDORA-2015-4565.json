						"thetext": "While the patch that was applied to libzip (either upstream or bundled with PHP, see comment 4 and comment 0 respectively) is applicable to libzip versions prior to 0.11, it is only required in 0.11 and later.  The 0.11 version introduced Zip64 support and made it possible to call the affected _zip_cdir_new() with large enough nentry argument to trigger overflow.\n\nIn versions before 0.11, the _zip_cdir_new() function was called from _zip_readcdir() function when reading Zip files.  The nentry value is directly read from an input file as short / 2 byte value.  Hence the maximum possible nentry value is 0xffff / 65535.  This is insufficient to trigger integer overflow when multiplied by sizeof(struct zip_dirent).\n\nThe following libzip upstream commit adds support for reading Zip64 central directory.\n\nhttp://hg.nih.at/libzip/rev/6a817a320838\n\nIn this format, number of entries in the directory is stored as 64 bit value, rather than 16 bit used in the original Zip format.  There are now two code paths to call _zip_cdir_new() when reading Zip file - _zip_read_eocd() handling old central directory format and _zip_read_eocd64() handling Zip64 central directory.  In the latter case, nentry value is 64 bit and hence can trigger integer overflow in _zip_cdir_new().\n\nNote that only this upstream commit changed nentry type in _zip_cdir_new() from int to zip_uint64_t, so it seems integer overflow was only possible on 32 bit systems for versions between this and the above commit.\n\nhttp://hg.nih.at/libzip/rev/52de63d0c791#l7.1\n\nNote that there is similar problem in the _zip_cdir_grow() function, which was introduced via the following commit:\n\nhttp://hg.nih.at/libzip/rev/54290e506680\n\nAccording to the NEWS file, it first appeared in version 0.9.1.  It seems this change can make it possible for a malicious Zip file to cause nentry to be incremented to value that triggers integer overflow (only on 32 bit systems, as nentry continues to be int).  However, as nentry is only incremented slowly (by 0xffff, which means less than 4mb increase on each re-allocation), it's not really possible to trigger this without causing memory allocation failure earlier.  Note that upstream commit linked in comment 4 does not correct the _zip_cdir_grow() function, but that function is no longer called in current 0.11.2 version.\n\nThe libzip packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7 are based on upstream versions 0.9 and 0.10.1, and hence are not affected by this issue.\n\nThe PHP packages in Red Hat products embed the following libzip versions:\n- PHP 5.3.3 (in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6) - libzip 0.9.3\n- PHP 5.4 and 5.5 (in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and Red Hat Software Collections) - libzip 0.10.1\n- PHP 5.6 - libzip 0.11.2\n\nTherefore no PHP packages in Red Hat products were affected.  Neither upstream PHP 5.4 and 5.5 needed this handled as a security fix."
