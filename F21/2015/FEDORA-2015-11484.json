Spoofing attacks against setups with validation disabled would require attacker to be MITM (man in the middle) or able to efficiently predict or guess request ports and transaction IDs.  For issues as this DoS, it should be sufficient for attacker to force resolution of name in a domain they control.  That can be done directly if attacker is allowed to resolve host names via target server, or indirectly by forcing some authorized client to do resolution (e.g. by making users visit attacker controlled web page, or making some network service, such as mail server, resolve attacker supplied name)."
