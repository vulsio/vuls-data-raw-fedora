						"thetext": "I've installed Fedora 21 on a Dell XPS 13 9343 (2015 model) and I'm seeing some peculiar trackpad freezes.  I can use the trackpad for a good while but then it will refuse to move around the screen any longer.  Clicks (left, right, and middle) seem to work but the pointer is locked in place.\n\nIf I use 'evtest' to monitor the device, I see constant X/Y and button input when I use trackpad (even when the pointer freezes on screen).  However, if I use 'xinput --test' with the device, I do not see any X/Y input (only clicks) in the terminal.  If I keep mashing the touchpad with different finger combinations, the device will eventually start working again.\n\nCould this be a possible problem in the X driver for synaptics since the kernel still sees activity with evtest?\n\nThis happens under kernels 3.17.4, 3.18.3, and 3.18.5.  I've tried xorg-x11-drv-synaptics-1.8.1-2.fc21 from updatest-testing but it has no impact.\n\n$ xinput --list\n⎡ Virtual core pointer                    \tid=2\t[master pointer  (3)]\n⎜   ↳ Virtual core XTEST pointer              \tid=4\t[slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ Logitech Unifying Device.

It seems to happen when I apply two fingers to the trackpad for a right-click tap or click or for a two finger vertical scroll.  If I try to do a vertical scroll with two fingers, it's like the touchpad gets stuck in scrolling mode and won't let me move the pointer again -- even if I remove all fingers from the touchpad for several seconds.\n\nOften times if I use two ringers to do a right click, the touchpad will freeze.  The only way to release is to wildly click with one or two fingers until the pointer starts moving again or the touchpad gets into a horrible state and I have to modprobe -r hid_multitouch to bring it back. ;)\n\nHowever, I did find that if I *always* use only one finger, the touchpad doesn't freeze.  Two or three finger clicks/gestures cause it to freeze almost immediately.\n\nI did find it unusual that evemu reported that the touchpad has a BTN_LEFT event but no BTN_RIGHT:\n\n#   Event type 1 (EV_KEY)\n#     Event code 272 (BTN_LEFT)\n#     Event code 325 (BTN_TOOL_FINGER)\n#     Event code 330 (BTN_TOUCH)\n#     Event code 333 (BTN_TOOL_DOUBLETAP)\n#     Event code 334 (BTN_TOOL_TRIPLETAP)"

I left out a bunch! :)\n\nI ran your grabtest script in a loop while I was using the touchpad and it showed success even through two touchpad \"freezes\" in GNOME.  I never saw it say anything other than \"success\" in a 4-5 minute road test.\n\nI tested the evemu output from last night with evemu-play this morning and the movements all look normal.  I didn't see any lockups or freezes on screen when I replayed the data from last night.  However, the touchpad was in its usual frozen state AFTER the playback was done.\n\nAfter going back over the evemu-record output, it seems that this sequence makes the touchpad freeze:\n\nE: 1.050649 0001 0145 0000\t# EV_KEY / BTN_TOOL_FINGER      0\nE: 1.050649 0001 014d 0001\t# EV_KEY / BTN_TOOL_DOUBLETAP   1\n\nThis normally shows up if I apply more than one finger to the pad for vertical scrolling or a right-click.  I'm unable to do two-finger or three-finger taps on the pad -- they don't register in X.  Only single finger taps have any effect.\n\nI'll get you the Xorg logs this evening.  Let me know if there's anything else to test in the meantime."

FINGER, DOUBLETAP, TRIPLETAP, etc. are the markers for one, two, three, etc. fingers on the touchpad. Not all touchpads support proper multitouch but some can tell when there's more than one finger on the touchpad, hence the special keys.\n\nnothing interesting in the log, but the BUG message is a hint, that usually happens when the touchpoint count is wrong. The trick is getting an evemu recording that reproduces it, without it it's a lot of guesswork.\nGenerally once you get the message once all bets are off and you need to restart X, it can only get worse. (there was a very common bug that triggered this after suspend but that has been fixed since, so I doubt anything you find in bugzilla is a duplicate)\n\nAlso, if libinput suffers from the same issue it's almost certainly some issue with the kernel event sequence.\n\nFinal note: the sequence you attached leaves one touchpoint on the device. If you replay that through your normal touchpad device, the touch count will be off after that. That'll give you false positives. Replay it through a uinput device to be safe, or record a sequence that ends with you releasing all fingers."

The touchpad already works well in I2C mode with patches in 4.0rc1 (er, I think; maybe it's just in master and didn't quite make rc1). The soundcard I2S work is ongoing. Dell is working on the HDA + PS/2 option because they want to support the kernel used in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, to which it would be very hard to backport the required I2S support. They're also working on some BIOS/embedded controller firmware fixes which will likely improve the situation for the HDA + PS/2 option.\n\nSo I expect this hardware will be well supported soon, given Dell's commitment of resources plus ongoing work by other hardware companies and outside developers."

Among the upgrades there were these Atheros AR5B195 Mni PCIe combo cards, which expose their bluetooth part over the USB bus.\n(See here: https://wikidevi.com/wiki/Atheros_AR5B195)\n\nThe WLAN works fine, but the bluetooth part appears in lsusb as\n\n04f2:aff1 Chicony Electronics Co., Ltd\n\nwhen it should be something like Atheros AR3011 Bluetooth adapter. However, the issue is not just cosmetic; even though ath3k and btusb are both loaded, bluetooth doesn't work at all, hcitool does not list any devices and \"hciconfig hci0 up\" times out.\n\nAs per the instructions here\n\nhttps://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/en/users/Drivers/ath3k#ar3011_with_sflash_configurations\n\nI've prepared a patch against kernel 3.18 that adds the PID & VID of the devices.\n\nA similar patch at kernel.org's git for a different device:\n\nhttp://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git/commit/?id=e9036e336a8e5640871e0006ea4a89982b25046f&id2=840af824b2bf9194ea596e0ddc7aa05066794ca1#patch1\n\nAfter googling a bit, I saw that this particular issue had appeared around 3.0-3.1. Ubuntu had a similar bug report, but although they claim it was fixed upstream, there is no such thing in the source:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/linux/+bug/841673\nWe also have bugs #882693, #734369 and #702375 from about that same time.\n\nFrom what I understand, this works a bit like usb_modeswitch, so similar patches with the appropriate vendor and product IDs would solve a lot of people's problems.\n\nPlease, is there any chance this could land in F21 sometime in the next 10 days, so that I can make my deadline?"

Download the Fedora cloud image (https://getfedora.org/en_GB/cloud/download/ ).\n2. Convert the raw disk to a VMDK (e.g.\nqemu-img convert -O vmdk -o adapter_type=lsilogic Fedora-Cloud-Base-20141203-21.x86_64.raw Fedora-Cloud-Base-20141203-21.x86_64.vmdk\n). \n3. Create a new VM and ensure the disk type is set to SCSI (VMware Fusion 7.1.1).\n4. Boot the VM. \n\nActual results:\nHang.\n\nExpected results:\nVM to finish booting.\n\nAdditional info:\nCloser inspection shows the issue is because the \"disk\" requires the \"Fusion MPT SPI Host\" driver which isn't present in the base cloud image but is part of the kernel-modules package. If you can somehow get the kernel-modules RPM into the image and then rerun dracut this problem goes away."
