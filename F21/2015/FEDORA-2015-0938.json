However, when starting adb directly, the device is reachable.\n\nVersion-Release number of selected component (if applicable):\nandroid-tools-20130123git98d0789-1.fc18.x86_64\n\nHow reproducible:\nAlways. Tried on two different systems with FC18 installed.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. USB connect an Android device with Android 4.2.2 and USB debugging enabled\n2. sudo systemctl start adb\n3. adb devices --> will show that the device is attached, but offline\n4. sudo systemctl stop adb\n5. sudo adb start-server\n6. adb devices --> will show that the device is attached and available\n\nActual results:\nDevice is always offline when adb was started via systemctl, but available when adb start-server was invoked as root.\n\nExpected results:\nDevice should be available on both ways.\n\nAdditional info:\nOn both cases, ps shows a process \"adb -P 5037 fork-server server\" which is owned by root. I cannot find a reason why it shouldn't work with systemctl.\n\n--- Additional comment from Ivan Afonichev on 2013-05-25 10:34:36 PDT ---\n\nIt seems adb needs $HOME dir to create .android/ dir and generate public keys here.\n\nWhat is your opinion where adb should place this data? Should it be /root/ or something else?\n\n\n\nTemporary workaround for this bug:\nCreate /etc/systemd/system/adb.service with contents like here:\n\n[root@van-ssd ~]# cat /etc/systemd/system/adb.service \n.include /lib/systemd/system/adb.service \n[Service]\nEnvironment=HOME=/root/\n\n--- Additional comment from Richard Körber on 2013-05-26 05:46:09 PDT ---\n\nThanks for the workaround.\n\nI don't think system services should use /root for storing data. I created /var/lib/adb/ and let the Environment=HOME point there. Now the adb service works fine.\n\nHowever, as I don't know too much about Linux internas, maybe there is a better location for the adb home directory...\n\n--- Additional comment from Fedora End Of Life on 2013-12-21 05:43:38 PST ---\n\nThis message is a reminder that Fedora 18 is nearing its end of life.\nApproximately 4 (four) weeks from now Fedora will stop maintaining\nand issuing updates for Fedora 18. It is Fedora's policy to close all\nbug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time\nthis bug will be closed as WONTFIX if it remains open with a Fedora \n'version' of '18'.\n\nPackage Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you\nplan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version' \nto a later Fedora version prior to Fedora 18's end of life.\n\nThank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we may not be \nable to fix it before Fedora 18 is end of life. If you would still like \nto see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version \nof Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora \nversion prior to Fedora 18's end of life.\n\nAlthough we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's \nlifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a \nmore recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes \nbugs or makes them obsolete.\n\n--- Additional comment from Thomas Moschny on 2014-09-16 06:21:33 PDT ---\n\nPing, any news here?\n\n--- Additional comment from Fedora Update System on 2015-01-18 14:09:48 PST ---\n\nandroid-tools-20141219git8393e50-2.fc21 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 21.\nhttps://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/android-tools-20141219git8393e50-2.fc21\n\n--- Additional comment from Fedora Update System on 2015-01-20 13:05:12 PST ---\n\nPackage android-tools-20141219git8393e50-2.fc21:\n* should fix your issue,\n* was pushed to the Fedora 21 testing repository,\n* should be available at your local mirror within two days.\nUpdate it with:\n# su -c 'yum update --enablerepo=updates-testing android-tools-20141219git8393e50-2.fc21'\nas soon as you are able to.\nPlease go to the following url:\nhttps://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2015-0938/android-tools-20141219git8393e50-2.fc21\nthen log in and leave karma (feedback).\n\n--- Additional comment from Fedora Update System on 2015-02-14 19:20:29 PST ---\n\nandroid-tools-20141219git8393e50-2.fc21 has been pushed to the Fedora 21 stable repository.

Obviously, you'll need to regenerate the core and extra tarballs from upstream git.\n\nI have added two patches, one to strip out selinux/android.h which seems to be unused by the code we compile (and therefore allows us to compile using the system selinux library), and the second to add in a missed header in f2fs_ioutils (no idea why it's missing; I'm assuming it has something to do with the difference between the android buildsystem and our own).\n\nI do have a srpm and F21 x86_64 rpm available at http://lesloueizeh.com/jdieter/android-tools and the srpm will have the necessary core and extras git checkouts."
