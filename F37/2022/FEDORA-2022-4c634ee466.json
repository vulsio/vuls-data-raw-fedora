See:\n\t* [`configDefinition.followingSpace`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_plugins_mentions_configDefinition.html#property-followingSpace) option for the mentions plugin, and\n\t* [`config.emoji_followingSpace`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.html#cfg-emoji_followingSpace) option for the emoji plugin.\n* [#5215](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/5215): Added the [`config.coreStyles_toggleSubSup`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.html#cfg-coreStyles_toggleSubSup) configuration option which disallows setting the subscript and superscript on the same element simultaneously using UI buttons. This option is turned off by default.\n\nFixed Issues:\n\n* [#4889](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/4889): Fixed: Incorrect position of the [Table Resize](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/tableresize) cursor after scrolling the editor horizontally.\n* [#5319](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/5319): Fixed: [Autolink](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/autolink) [`config.autolink_urlRegex`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.html#cfg-autolink_urlRegex) option produced invalid links when configured directly using the editor instance config. Thanks to [Aigars Zeiza](https://github.com/Zuzon)!\n* [#4941](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/4941): Fixed: Some entities got wrongly encoded when using [`entities_processNumerical = true`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.html#cfg-entities_processNumerical) configuration option.\n* [#4931](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/4931): Fixed: Selecting the whole editor content when there is only a list with an empty element at the end inside and deleting it did not delete all list items.\n\n\nAPI changes:\n\n* [#5122](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/5122): Added the ability to provide a list of buttons as an array to the [`config.removeButtons`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.html#cfg-removeButtons) config variable.\n* [#2008](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor-dev/pull/2008): Added [Autocomplete](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/autocomplete) [`followingSpace`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_plugins_autocomplete_configDefinition.html#property-followingSpace) option that finishes an accepted match with a space.\n\n## CKEditor 4.19.1\n\nFixed Issues:\n\n* [#5125](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/5125): Fixed: Deleting a widget with disabled [autoParagraph](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.html#cfg-autoParagraph) by the keyboard `backspace` key removes the editor editable area and crashes the editor.\n* [#5135](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/5135): Fixed: The [`checkbox.setValue`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_ui_dialog_checkbox.html#method-setValue) and [`radio.setValue`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_ui_dialog_radio.html#method-setValue) methods are not chainable as stated in the documentation.
