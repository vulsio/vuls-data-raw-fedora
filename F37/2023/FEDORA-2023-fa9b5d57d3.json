It's so great. Yes, sure, the GUI looks very different, and at first I was a little bit upset. Users may have to adapt their settings so that they get a proper look & feel for their needs. But truth is, that's done in a couple of minutes and then you're happy.\n\nRegarding technical features, I haven't noticed much of a difference. Works all the same like before, whatever way you may want to look at it, positive or negative. Although the big bump in the version number may suggest differently, it's not really that big of an update. But I'm no expert here, maybe it's all different under the hood and the upgrade was just so smooth that I haven't noticed all the big improvements and changes.\n\nAnyway, to make it short, I wouldn't want to go back, I really like to stay with Thunderbird 115, although now it worries me a little bit that there are no updates since July. However, with Fedora 39 to be released by the end of this month, then I'll have Thunderbird 115 by default. But still would be nice to have official updates for 115 on Fedora 38 until then.\n\nThat's all just my opinion. Keep up the good work!"
