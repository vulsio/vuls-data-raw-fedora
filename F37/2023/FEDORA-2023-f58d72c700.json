Grab the Gemfile and Gemfile.lock\n  a) Gemfile: https://github.com/sclorg/rails-ex/blob/67b7a61eae9efa1088ff3f634ae316e1022fa913/Gemfile\n     Gemfile.lock: https://github.com/sclorg/rails-ex/blob/67b7a61eae9efa1088ff3f634ae316e1022fa913/Gemfile.lock\n  b) optionally clone the whole project: https://github.com/sclorg/rails-ex\n2. $ bundle install --path ./bundle\n3. It doesn't terminate and keeps repeating:\n~~~~\n$ bundle install --path ./bundle\n[DEPRECATED] The `--path` flag is deprecated because it relies on being remembered across bundler invocations, which bundler will no longer do in future versions. Instead please use `bundle config set --local path './bundle'`, and stop using this flag\nFetching gem metadata from https://rubygems.org/..........\nResolving dependencies...\nResolving dependencies...\nResolving dependencies...\nResolving dependencies...\nResolving dependencies...\nResolving dependencies...\nResolving dependencies...\nResolving dependencies...\n<...snip...>\n~~~\n\nActual results:\nProcess locks up in a cycle.

Therefore, there might be some gem in the Gemfile that doesn't play nice with the rest, but to us, it is important that bundler does not lock up in a cycle.\n\nYou can reproduce in containers using a `Dockerfile` with following contents:\n~~~\nFROM registry.fedoraproject.org/fedora:37\n\nRUN dnf install -y ruby ruby-devel rubygem-bundler git\n\nRUN rpm -qa ruby rubygem-bundler # Print NVRs\n\nWORKDIR /opt/\n\nRUN git clone https://github.com/sclorg/rails-ex app-src # Get the app with the reproducer Gemfile\n\nUSER 0\n\nRUN chown -R 1000:1000 ./ # Fix perms to not be a root account for bundle install\n\nUSER 1000\n\nWORKDIR /opt/app-src\n\nRUN bundle install --path ./bundle\n\nCMD exec bundle exec \"rackup -P /tmp/rack.pid --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080\"\n~~~\nThen simply run `podman build --no-cache .` in the same directory as the `Dockerfile`.\n\nYou can exchange `:37` with `:36` for the `FROM`, the result is the same."
