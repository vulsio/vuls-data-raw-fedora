The man page for subscriptions.conf(5) is unhelpful, but states that \"This file is not intended to be edited or managed manually\".\n\n\nReproducible: Always\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.Boot system with cupsd enabled\n2.Monitor the journal\n\nActual Results:  \nThe journal is cluttered with repeated messages from CUPS at 1-second intervals, making the rest of the journal hard to read without filtering.\n\nExpected Results:  \nCUPS should be silent unless it has something useful (i.e. actionable) to say.\n\nThis has been going on over several releases of Fedora and other Linux distros. Some online comments say that the root problem is a timing issue in CUPS itself, but I've no idea if this is true. It's just very annoying."
