The impact is that some mandatory headers could be dropped after their presence was confirmed ... resulting in a request smuggling attack. Also this empty header could be used\nto make a transfer-encoding or content-length disappear while the internal parser still thinks it's there since it was seen ... I guess some (attackers) might be creative enough to exploit it ...\n\nThe fix ... applies well as far as v2.0 ...\n\nI would like to propose an early coordinated release date ... \nTuesday 14th 7pm CET ... \nit shouldn't take long to some attackers to figure how to exploit this to bypass some URL checks"

The impact is that some mandatory headers could be dropped after their presence was confirmed ... resulting in a request smuggling attack. Also this empty header could be used\nto make a transfer-encoding or content-length disappear while the internal parser still thinks it's there since it was seen ... I guess some (attackers) might be creative enough to exploit it ...\n\nThe fix ... applies well as far as v2.0 ...\n\nI would like to propose an early coordinated release date ... \nTuesday 14th 7pm CET ... \nit shouldn't take long to some attackers to figure how to exploit this to bypass some URL checks"
