This leads\n  to delays of ~511 seconds once all ports between 512-1023 are\n  exhausted.  Even when ports become available, lpd_queue() still tries\n  calling cups_rresvport() with port numbers less than 512, waiting one\n  second between each call.\n\nVersion-Release number of selected component (if applicable):\n\n  cups-2.3.3op2-16.el9.x86_64\n\nHow reproducible:\n\n  100%\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\n  1. Create a print queue that sends jobs to an LPD print device.\n  2. Submit ~550 jobs to the LPD printer.\n\n  After ~511 jobs have been transfered via LPD, the lpd backend will\n  block waiting for reserved ports to move out of TIME_WAIT and become\n  available for re-use.\n\nActual results:\n\n  Even after reserved ports become available for re-use, the lpd backend\n  waits ~511 seconds before continuing to send jobs to the LPD print\n  device.\n\nExpected results:\n\n  After reserved ports become available for re-use, the lpd backend\n  should immediately continue sending jobs to the LPD print device.\n\nAdditional info:\n\n  Upstream PR to fix the issue:\n  \n  Fix delays printing to lpd when reserved ports are exhausted\n  https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cups/pull/741"

Run \"cancel -x <job>\" for a valid job id currently in a queue.\n\nActual results:\n\n  Job files in /var/spool/cups should be removed\n\nExpected results:\n\n  Job files are not removed.\n\nAdditional info:\n\n  The command \"cancel -x \" adds \"purge-jobs true\" to the Cancel-Job\n  operation; however, the correct attribute to use for Cancel-job is\n  \"purge-job\" (singular), not \"purge-jobs\" (plural). As a result, job\n  files are not removed from /var/spool/cups when \"cancel -x \" is\n  executed.\n\n  Upstream PR with patch that resolves the issue\n\n    Use \"purge-job\" instead of \"purge-jobs\" when canceling a single job\n    https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cups/pull/742"
