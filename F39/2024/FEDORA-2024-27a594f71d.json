Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to perform actions on behalf of other users. The vulnerability is found in `templates_import.php.` When uploading an xml template file, if the XML file does not pass the check, the server will give a JavaScript pop-up prompt, which contains unfiltered xml template file name, resulting in XSS. An attacker exploiting this vulnerability could execute actions on behalf of other users. This ability to impersonate users could lead to unauthorized changes to settings. As of time of publication, no patched versions are available.\n\nhttps://github.com/Cacti/cacti/blob/5f6f65c215d663a775950b2d9db35edbaf07d680/templates_import.php\nhttps://github.com/Cacti/cacti/security/advisories/GHSA-xwqc-7jc4-xm73\n\n\nCacti is an open source operational monitoring and fault management framework. The fix applied for CVE-2023-39515 in version 1.2.25 is incomplete as it enables an adversary to have a victim browser execute malicious code when a victim user hovers their mouse over the malicious data source path in `data_debug.php`. To perform the cross-site scripting attack, the adversary needs to be an authorized cacti user with the following permissions: `General Administration>Sites/Devices/Data`. The victim of this attack could be any account with permissions to view `http://<HOST>/cacti/data_debug.php`. As of time of publication, no complete fix has been included in Cacti.\n\nhttps://github.com/Cacti/cacti/blob/5f6f65c215d663a775950b2d9db35edbaf07d680/data_debug.php\nhttps://github.com/Cacti/cacti/security/advisories/GHSA-hrg9-qqqx-wc4h\nhttps://github.com/Cacti/cacti/security/advisories/GHSA-q7g7-gcf6-wh4x\n\nCacti provides an operational monitoring and fault management framework. Version 1.2.25 has a Blind SQL Injection (SQLi) vulnerability within the SNMP Notification Receivers feature in the file `‘managers.php’`. An authenticated attacker with the “Settings/Utilities” permission can send a crafted HTTP GET request to the endpoint `‘/cacti/managers.php’` with an SQLi payload in the `‘selected_graphs_array’` HTTP GET parameter. As of time of publication, no patched versions exist.\n\nhttps://github.com/Cacti/cacti/blob/5f6f65c215d663a775950b2d9db35edbaf07d680/managers.php#L941\nhttps://github.com/Cacti/cacti/security/advisories/GHSA-w85f-7c4w-7594\n\nCacti provides an operational monitoring and fault management framework. In versions 1.2.25 and prior, it is possible to execute arbitrary SQL code through the `pollers.php` script. An authorized user may be able to execute arbitrary SQL code. The vulnerable component is the `pollers.php`. Impact of the vulnerability - arbitrary SQL code execution. As of time of publication, a patch does not appear to exist.\n\nhttps://github.com/Cacti/cacti/blob/5f6f65c215d663a775950b2d9db35edbaf07d680/pollers.php#L451\nhttps://github.com/Cacti/cacti/security/advisories/GHSA-vr3c-38wh-g855"

Prior to version 1.2.27, Cacti calls `compat_password_hash` when users set their password. `compat_password_hash` use `password_hash` if there is it, else use `md5`. When verifying password, it calls `compat_password_verify`. In `compat_password_verify`, `password_verify` is called if there is it, else use `md5`. `password_verify` and `password_hash` are supported on PHP < 5.5.0, following PHP manual. The vulnerability is in `compat_password_verify`. Md5-hashed user input is compared with correct password in database by `$md5 == $hash`. It is a loose comparison, not `===`. It is a type juggling vulnerability. Version 1.2.27 contains a patch for the issue.\n\nhttps://github.com/Cacti/cacti/security/advisories/GHSA-37x7-mfjv-mm7m"

Prior to version 1.2.27, an arbitrary file write vulnerability, exploitable through the \"Package Import\" feature, allows authenticated users having the \"Import Templates\" permission to execute arbitrary PHP code on the web server. The vulnerability is located within the `import_package()` function defined into the `/lib/import.php` script. The function blindly trusts the filename and file content provided within the XML data, and writes such files into the Cacti base path (or even outside, since path traversal sequences are not filtered). This can be exploited to write or overwrite arbitrary files on the web server, leading to execution of arbitrary PHP code or other security impacts.
