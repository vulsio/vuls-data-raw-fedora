								"thetext": "Hi all,\n\nWe released PowerDNS DNSdist 1.9.4 today. This release fixes \nCVE-2024-25581, a denial of service security issue affecting versions \n1.9.0, 1.9.1, 1.9.2 and 1.9.3 only. Earlier versions are not affected.\n\nWhen incoming DNS over HTTPS support is enabled using the nghttp2 \nprovider, and queries are routed to a tcp-only or DNS over TLS backend, \nan attacker can trigger an assertion failure in DNSdist by sending a \nrequest for a zone transfer (AXFR or IXFR) over DNS over HTTPS, causing \nthe process to stop and thus leading to a Denial of Service.\n\nDNS over HTTPS is not enabled by default, and backends are using plain \nDNS (Do53) by default.\n\nTwo work-arounds are available:\n- refuse incoming XFR requests via a DNSdist rule: \naddAction(OrRule({QTypeRule(DNSQType.AXFR), QTypeRule(DNSQType.IXFR)}), \nRCodeAction(DNSRCode.REFUSED))\n- switch to the legacy h2o provider by setting library='h2o' in the \naddDOHLocal directive\n\nWe would like to thank Daniel Stirnimann from Switch for finding and \nsubsequently reporting this issue.\n\nThe full security advisory is provided below, and can also be\nfound at\nhttps://dnsdist.org/security-advisories/powerdns-advisory-for-dnsdist-2024-03.html\n\nA minimal patch can also be found here:\nhttps://downloads.powerdns.com/patches/2024-03/\n\nPlease feel free to contact me directly if you have any question.\n\nBest regards,\n\n-- \nRemi Gacogne\nPowerDNS.COM BV - https://www.powerdns.com/\n\nPowerDNS Security Advisory 2024-03: Transfer requests received over DoH \ncan lead to a denial of service in DNSdist\n==================================================================================================================\n\n- CVE: CVE-2024-25581\n- Date: May 13th 2024\n- Affects: PowerDNS DNSdist 1.9.0, 1.9.1, 1.9.2 and 1.9.3, earlier \nversions are not affected\n- Not affected: PowerDNS DNSdist 1.9.4\n- Severity: High (only in specific configurations, see below)\n- Impact: Denial of service\n- Exploit: This problem can be triggered by a remote, unauthenticated \nattacker sending a DNS query\n- Risk of system compromise: None\n- Solution: Upgrade to patched version or apply the workaround described \nbelow\n\nWhen incoming DNS over HTTPS support is enabled using the nghttp2 \nprovider, and queries are routed to a tcp-only or\nDNS over TLS backend, an attacker can trigger an assertion failure in \nDNSdist by sending a request for a zone transfer\n(AXFR or IXFR) over DNS over HTTPS, causing the process to stop and thus \nleading to a Denial of Service.\nDNS over HTTPS is not enabled by default, and backends are using plain \nDNS (Do53) by default.\n\n`CVSS Score: 7.5 \n<https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H&version=3.1>`__, \nonly for configurations where incoming DoH is enabled and a TCP-only/DoT \nbackend is enabled.\n\nTwo workarounds are available:\n- refuse incoming XFR requests via a DNSdist rule: \n``addAction(OrRule({QTypeRule(DNSQType.AXFR), \nQTypeRule(DNSQType.IXFR)}), RCodeAction(DNSRCode.REFUSED))``\n- switch to the legacy h2o provider by setting ``library='h2o'`` in the \n``addDOHLocal`` directive\n\nFor those unable to upgrade to a new version, a minimal patch is \n`available for 1.9.3 <https://downloads.powerdns.com/patches/2024-03>`__\n\nWe would like to thank Daniel Stirnimann from Switch for finding and \nsubsequently reporting this issue."
