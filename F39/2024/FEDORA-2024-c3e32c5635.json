While the total number of requests is bounded to the http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing one is still executing.\n\nThis CVE is specific to golang, but is also tracked as CVE-2023-44487.\n\nThis flaw is a duplicate of 2243296.
