After filing a bug on Chromium's issue tracker [https://issues.chromium.org/issues/41492618), we were able to track the problem to the fact that on Fedora Chromium is incapable of dynamically loading H264 libs (even though they are installed), and therefore it cannot stream H264 content.\n\nThis first issue was closed as an MS Teams issue, so I created a new, more specific one (https://issues.chromium.org/issues/324534609), but this last one was closed as \"won't fix -- intended behavior\" with the final comment saying \"We don't provide support for distro builds. They often use custom Chromium patches. You'll need to reach out to Fedora.\". So, here we are, hoping this is the right place and the issue will finally be addressed.\n\nReproducible: Always\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Join a meeting with MS Teams \n2. Try to stream video of any kind (camera, screencast etc.)\n3.\nActual Results:  \nNo video of any kind is streamed inbound or outbound.\n\nExpected Results:  \nVideo should be properly sent and received."
