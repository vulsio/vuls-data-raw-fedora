That part still runs as root. Sure, the user session process inherit this env variable and can change it, but I thought that these are copies, not the same memory as pam_putenv() uses. That would be rather wild, as these are different security domains. \n\natoi() *by itself* does not crash on invalid inputs, it just doesn't return precise errors. If number conversion fails, then it returns 0, and then pam_sm_close_session() will not do anything.\n\nSo *if* the user session can tamper with the pam handle's SSH_AGENT_PID, then the maximum possible exploit would be to kill arbitrary PIDs (i.e. local authenticated DoS). However, if that's possible, then the user session can also do heaven knows other things to corrupt the PAM handle..\n\nLuna, Paolo: How can that be exploited? Do you have any details? Thanks!"

I'll report this, but that just means that the bug/exploit can't be tested in Fedora 40.\n\nuser_readenv is enabled by default in Debian 12, and ssh'ing into the VM with the above ~/.pam_environment does give me $SSH_AGENT_PID=pwned in the session. I confirm that pam-ssh-add's pam_sm_close_session() does see that changed value. This is indeed a rather major surprise, and I figure that's the reason for that warning:\n\n  Due to problematic security this functionality is deprecated since the 1.5.0 version and will be removed completely at some point in the future.\n\nSo I can see the local privilege escalation/DoS: by creating a ~/.pam_environment file in some distributions, users can SIGTERM an arbitrary process in the system.\n\nHowever, I don't understand how this is related to an \"integer overflow\" -- the current code parses \"pwned\" (or any other non-number) as 0, which the code ignores. Moving to strtol() doesn't change anything wrt. to that other than producing an extra warning. But if the user specifies a valid positive value, then you could still kill an arbitrary process with that.\n\n\nTo fix this in a better way, how about using pam_{set,get}_data() to store and retrieve the agent pid? That can't be tampered with by the user session."

There's no crash or arbitrary code execution, a too high string value will just make atoi() return 0. I.e. representing this as an integer overflow is misleading IMHO -- it's a mild local privilege escalation (local authenticated DoS).\n\nI'm already working on a patch, currently testing it on Debian stable.\n\nRight now this bugzilla is private, so I won't send a (public) upstream PR) without your consent.

I suppose that's what OpenSUSE wants to do. But that's a question for Paolo (who called for the embargo).\n\nThanks!"

						"thetext": "Release note draft, feedback appreciated!\n\n\n## pam-ssh-add: Fix insecure killing of session ssh-agent [CVE-2024-6126]\n\nThe [`pam_env` PAM module](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/pam_env.8.html) has a (deprecated) `user_readenv` option. Some distributions like Debian or Ubuntu enable this option by default, so Cockpit's PAM config in `/etc/pam.d/cockpit` enables it as well there. It's also possible to manually enable that option in other distributions such as Fedora or Red Hat Enterprise Linux.\n\nCockpit's own `pam_ssh_add` module had a vulnerability when `user_readenv` is enabled. A local authenticated user could craft a `~/.pam_environment` file which would kill an arbitrary process on the system with root privileges when logging out of a Cockpit session. This could cause a Denial of Service. Version 320 fixes this problem.\n\nThis is tracked as [CVE-2024-2947](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-2947). If you need to backport this to older cockpit versions, you can apply the [upstream patch](https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/commit/XXXTODO).\n\nIf you cannot install the new version or the patch, and you have potentially malicious local user on a system running Cockpit, you can mitigate this vulnerability by removing the `user_readenv=1` option from the `pam_env.so` line in `/etc/pam.d/cockpit`. This will disable reading any extra environment variables in user's `~/.pam_environment` files; the most common use of that is to set a local different from the system default.\n\nMany thanks to Paolo Perego <paolo.perego@suse.com> for discovering, and Luna Dragon <luna.dragon@suse.com> for reporting this issue!"
