A path traversal vulnerability impacts npm (server) users of Moment.js between versions 1.0.1 and 2.29.1, especially if a user-provided locale string is directly used to switch moment locale. This problem is patched in 2.29.2, and the patch can be applied to all affected versions. As a workaround, sanitize the user-provided locale name before passing it to Moment.js.\n\nhttps://github.com/moment/moment/commit/4211bfc8f15746be4019bba557e29a7ba83d54c5\nhttps://github.com/moment/moment/security/advisories/GHSA-8hfj-j24r-96c4"

So RHEL 8.5/8.6/9.0 are not affected at all. cockpit-composer apparently never used moment.js.\n\nCockpit in RHEL 7.9 still uses moment.js, and calls `moment.locale(cockpit.language)`. The user does not have arbitrary control over that, it is parsed from the existing po.LL.js headers, which are under cockpit source code control. And even then, cockpit-ws does not allow path traversal beyond the user session privileges that the user has anyway. So I am confident that this issue does not affect anything in the cockpit-* family."
