A revoked\n| domain name can still be resolvable for a long time, including expired\n| domains and taken-down malicious domains. The effects of an exploit\n| would be widespread and highly impactful, because the exploitation\n| conforms to de facto DNS specifications and operational practices, and\n| overcomes current mitigation patches for \"Ghost\" domain names.\n\nhttps://maradns.samiam.org/security.html#CVE-2022-30256\n\nIf you fix the vulnerability please also make sure to include the\nCVE (Common Vulnerabilities & Exposures) id in your changelog entry.\n\nFor further information see:\n\n[0] https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-30256\n    https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-30256\n\nPlease adjust the affected versions in the BTS as needed."

								"thetext": "In MaraDNS version 3.5.0024 and prior, a remotely exploitable integer underflow vulnerability in the DNS packet decompression function allows an attacker to cause a Denial of Service by triggering an abnormal program termination.\n\nThe vulnerability exists in the `decomp_get_rddata` function within the `Decompress.c` file. When handling a DNS packet with an Answer RR of qtype 16 (TXT record) and any qclass, if the `rdlength` is smaller than `rdata`, the result of the line `Decompress.c:886` is a negative number `len = rdlength - total;`. This value is then passed to the `decomp_append_bytes` function without proper validation, causing the program to attempt to allocate a massive chunk of memory that is impossible to allocate. Consequently, the program exits with an error code of 64, causing a Denial of Service.\n\nOne proposed fix for this vulnerability is to patch `Decompress.c:887` by breaking `if(len <= 0)`, which has been incorporated in version 3.5.0036 via commit bab062bde40b2ae8a91eecd522e84d8b993bab58.\n\nhttps://github.com/samboy/MaraDNS/security/advisories/GHSA-58m7-826v-9c3c\nhttps://github.com/samboy/MaraDNS/commit/bab062bde40b2ae8a91eecd522e84d8b993bab58\nhttps://github.com/samboy/MaraDNS/blob/08b21ea20d80cedcb74aa8f14979ec7c61846663/dns/Decompress.c#L886"
