						"thetext": "ISSUE DESCRIPTION\n=================\n\nWhen Xen sends requests to a device model, the next expected action\ninside Xen is tracked using a state field.  The requests themselves\nare placed in a memory page shared with the device model, so that the\ndevice model can communicate to Xen its progress on the request.  The\nstate field is in the request itself, where the device model may write\nto it.  Xen correctly rejects invalid state values, but failed to reject\ninvalid transitions between states.  As a result, a device model which\nswitches a request between two states at the right times can drive Xen\ninto an unbounded loop.\n\nIMPACT\n======\n\nA malicious unprivileged device model can cause a Denial of Service\n(DoS) affecting the entire host.  Specifically, it may prevent use of a\nphysical CPU for an indeterminate period of time.\n\nVULNERABLE SYSTEMS\n==================\n\nAll Xen versions are vulnerable.\n\nOnly x86 systems are affected.  ARM systems are not affected.\n\nOnly HVM guests can expose this vulnerability.  PV and PVH guests cannot\nexpose this vulnerability, but note that the domains being able to\nleverage the vulnerability are PV or PVH ones, running the device model.\n\nThis vulnerability is only applicable to Xen systems using stub domains.\n\nMITIGATION\n==========\n\nRunning only PV or PVH guests will avoid this issue.\n\n(The security of a Xen system using stub domains is still better than\nwith a qemu-dm running as an unrestricted dom0 process.  Therefore\nusers with these configurations should not switch to an unrestricted\ndom0 qemu-dm.)\n\nExternal References:\n\nhttp://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-262.html"

								"thetext": "ISSUE DESCRIPTION\n=================\n\nWhen Xen sends requests to a device model, the next expected action\ninside Xen is tracked using a state field.  The requests themselves\nare placed in a memory page shared with the device model, so that the\ndevice model can communicate to Xen its progress on the request.  The\nstate field is in the request itself, where the device model may write\nto it.  Xen correctly rejects invalid state values, but failed to reject\ninvalid transitions between states.  As a result, a device model which\nswitches a request between two states at the right times can drive Xen\ninto an unbounded loop.\n\nIMPACT\n======\n\nA malicious unprivileged device model can cause a Denial of Service\n(DoS) affecting the entire host.  Specifically, it may prevent use of a\nphysical CPU for an indeterminate period of time.\n\nVULNERABLE SYSTEMS\n==================\n\nAll Xen versions are vulnerable.\n\nOnly x86 systems are affected.  ARM systems are not affected.\n\nOnly HVM guests can expose this vulnerability.  PV and PVH guests cannot\nexpose this vulnerability, but note that the domains being able to\nleverage the vulnerability are PV or PVH ones, running the device model.\n\nThis vulnerability is only applicable to Xen systems using stub domains.\n\nMITIGATION\n==========\n\nRunning only PV or PVH guests will avoid this issue.\n\n(The security of a Xen system using stub domains is still better than\nwith a qemu-dm running as an unrestricted dom0 process.  Therefore\nusers with these configurations should not switch to an unrestricted\ndom0 qemu-dm.)\n\nExternal References:\n\nhttp://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-262.html"
