ARM systems are not vulnerable.\n\nOnly x86 PV guests can exploit the vulnerability. x86 HVM and PVH\nguests cannot exploit the vulnerability.\n\nAn attacker needs to be able to control hardware debugging facilities to\nexploit the vulnerability, but such permissions are typically available\nto unprivileged users.\n\nMITIGATION\n==========\n\nRunning only x86 HVM or PVH guests will avoid the vulnerability."

For that\nreason Xen explicitly check for the need to preempt the current vCPU at\ncertain points. A few rarely taken code paths did bypass such checks.\nBy suitably enforcing the conditions through its own page table\ncontents, a malicious guest may cause such bypasses to be used for an\nunbounded number of iterations.\n\nIMPACT\n======\n\nA malicious or buggy PV guest may cause a Denial of Service (DoS)\naffecting the entire host. Specifically, it may prevent use of a\nphysical CPU for an indeterminate period of time.\n\nVULNERABLE SYSTEMS\n==================\n\nAll Xen versions from 3.4 onwards are vulnerable. Xen versions 3.3 and\nearlier are vulnerable to an even wider class of attacks, due to them\nlacking preemption checks altogether in the affected code paths.\n\nOnly x86 systems are affected. ARM systems are not affected.\n\nOnly x86 PV guests can leverage the vulnerability. x86 HVM or PVH\nguests cannot leverage the vulnerability.\n\nMITIGATION\n==========\n\nRunning only HVM or PVH guests will avoid this vulnerability.\n\nFor PV guests, the vulnerability can be avoided if the guest kernel is\ncontrolled by the host rather than guest administrator, provided that\nfurther steps are taken to prevent the guest administrator from loading\ncode into the kernel (e.g. by disabling loadable modules etc) or from\nusing other mechanisms which allow them to run code at kernel privilege."

								"thetext": "ISSUE DESCRIPTION\n=================\n\nCertain PV MMU operations may take a long time to process. For that\nreason Xen explicitly check for the need to preempt the current vCPU at\ncertain points. A few rarely taken code paths did bypass such checks.\nBy suitably enforcing the conditions through its own page table\ncontents, a malicious guest may cause such bypasses to be used for an\nunbounded number of iterations.\n\nIMPACT\n======\n\nA malicious or buggy PV guest may cause a Denial of Service (DoS)\naffecting the entire host. Specifically, it may prevent use of a\nphysical CPU for an indeterminate period of time.\n\nVULNERABLE SYSTEMS\n==================\n\nAll Xen versions from 3.4 onwards are vulnerable. Xen versions 3.3 and\nearlier are vulnerable to an even wider class of attacks, due to them\nlacking preemption checks altogether in the affected code paths.\n\nOnly x86 systems are affected. ARM systems are not affected.\n\nOnly x86 PV guests can leverage the vulnerability. x86 HVM or PVH\nguests cannot leverage the vulnerability.\n\nMITIGATION\n==========\n\nRunning only HVM or PVH guests will avoid this vulnerability.\n\nFor PV guests, the vulnerability can be avoided if the guest kernel is\ncontrolled by the host rather than guest administrator, provided that\nfurther steps are taken to prevent the guest administrator from loading\ncode into the kernel (e.g. by disabling loadable modules etc) or from\nusing other mechanisms which allow them to run code at kernel privilege."
