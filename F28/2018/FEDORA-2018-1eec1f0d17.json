I still will fix eu-strip so we won't trip over this in the future if for some reason we do have to deal with many sections.\n\n>  That 27 MiB notes section is still very worrisome.\n\nYes. And ELF NOTES will be copied (not stripped) in the .debug file too (because they are expected to be small and useful in both the regular and debug file). So that is actually twice as bad. But that does seem to be a bug for annobin."
