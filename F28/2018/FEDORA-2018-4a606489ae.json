	"notes": "## 1.8.4 - 2018-08-01\n\n### Added\n\n- Nothing.\n\n### Changed\n\n- This release modifies how `ServerRequestFactory` marshals the request URI. In\n  prior releases, we would attempt to inspect the `X-Rewrite-Url` and\n  `X-Original-Url` headers, using their values, if present. These headers are\n  issued by the ISAPI_Rewrite module for IIS (developed by HeliconTech).\n  However, we have no way of guaranteeing that the module is what issued the\n  headers, making it an unreliable source for discovering the URI. As such, we\n  have removed this feature in this release of Diactoros.\n\n  If you are developing a middleware application, you can mimic the\n  functionality via middleware as follows:\n\n```\n  use Psr\\Http\\Message\\ResponseInterface;\n  use Psr\\Http\\Message\\ServerRequestInterface;\n  use Psr\\Http\\Server\\RequestHandlerInterface;\n  use Zend\\Diactoros\\Uri;\n\n  public function process(ServerRequestInterface $request, RequestHandlerInterface $handler) : ResponseInterface\n  {\n      $requestUri = null;\n\n      $httpXRewriteUrl = $request->getHeaderLine('X-Rewrite-Url');\n      if ($httpXRewriteUrl !== null) {\n          $requestUri = $httpXRewriteUrl;\n      }\n\n      $httpXOriginalUrl = $request->getHeaderLine('X-Original-Url');\n      if ($httpXOriginalUrl !== null) {\n          $requestUri = $httpXOriginalUrl;\n      }\n\n      if ($requestUri !== null) {\n          $request = $request->withUri(new Uri($requestUri));\n      }\n\n      return $handler->handle($request);\n  }\n```\n\n  If you use middleware such as the above, make sure you also instruct your web\n  server to strip any incoming headers of the same name so that you can\n  guarantee they are issued by the ISAPI_Rewrite module.\n\n### Deprecated\n\n- Nothing.\n\n### Removed\n\n- Nothing.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Nothing.\n\n## 1.8.3 - 2018-07-24\n\n### Added\n\n- Nothing.\n\n### Changed\n\n- Nothing.\n\n### Deprecated\n\n- Nothing.\n\n### Removed\n\n- Nothing.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- [#321](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-diactoros/pull/321) updates the logic in `Uri::withPort()` to ensure that it checks that the\n  value provided is either an integer or a string integer, as only those values\n  may be cast to integer without data loss.\n\n- [#320](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-diactoros/pull/320) adds checking within `Response` to ensure that the provided reason\n  phrase is a string; an `InvalidArgumentException` is now raised if it is not. This change\n  ensures the class adheres strictly to the PSR-7 specification.\n\n- [#319](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-diactoros/pull/319) provides a fix to `Zend\\Diactoros\\Response` that ensures that the status\n  code returned is _always_ an integer (and never a string containing an\n  integer), thus ensuring it strictly adheres to the PSR-7 specification.\n\n## 1.8.2 - 2018-07-19\n\n### Added\n\n- Nothing.\n\n### Changed\n\n- Nothing.\n\n### Deprecated\n\n- Nothing.\n\n### Removed\n\n- Nothing.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- [#318](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-diactoros/pull/318) fixes the logic for discovering whether an HTTPS scheme is in play\n  to be case insensitive when comparing header and SAPI values, ensuring no\n  false negative lookups occur.\n\n- [#314](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-diactoros/pull/314) modifies error handling around opening a file resource within\n  `Zend\\Diactoros\\Stream::setStream()` to no longer use the second argument to\n  `set_error_handler()`, and instead check the error type in the handler itself;\n  this fixes an issue when the handler is nested inside another error handler,\n  which currently has buggy behavior within the PHP engine.\n\n## 1.8.1 - 2018-07-09\n\n### Added\n\n- Nothing.\n\n### Changed\n\n- [#313](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-diactoros/pull/313) changes the reason phrase associated with the status code 425\n  to \"Too Early\", corresponding to a new definition of the code as specified by the IANA.\n\n### Deprecated\n\n- Nothing.\n\n### Removed\n\n- Nothing.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- [#312](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-diactoros/pull/312) fixes how the `normalizeUploadedFiles()` utility function handles nested trees of\n  uploaded files, ensuring it detects them properly.\n\n## 1.8.0 - 2018-06-27\n\n### Added\n\n- [#307](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-diactoros/pull/307) adds the following functions under the `Zend\\Diactoros` namespace, each of\n  which may be used to derive artifacts from SAPI supergloabls for the purposes\n  of generating a `ServerRequest` instance:\n  - `normalizeServer(array $server, callable $apacheRequestHeaderCallback = null) : array`\n    (main purpose is to aggregate the `Authorization` header in the SAPI params\n    when under Apache)\n  - `marshalProtocolVersionFromSapi(array $server) : string`\n  - `marshalMethodFromSapi(array $server) : string`\n  - `marshalUriFromSapi(array $server, array $headers) : Uri`\n  - `marshalHeadersFromSapi(array $server) : array`\n  - `parseCookieHeader(string $header) : array`\n  - `createUploadedFile(array $spec) : UploadedFile` (creates the instance from\n    a normal `$_FILES` entry)\n  - `normalizeUploadedFiles(array $files) : UploadedFileInterface[]` (traverses\n    a potentially nested array of uploaded file instances and/or `$_FILES`\n    entries, including those aggregated under mod_php, php-fpm, and php-cgi in\n    order to create a flat array of `UploadedFileInterface` instances to use in a\n    request)\n\n### Changed\n\n- Nothing.\n\n### Deprecated\n\n- [#307](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-diactoros/pull/307) deprecates `ServerRequestFactory::normalizeServer()`; the method is\n  no longer used internally, and users should instead use `Zend\\Diactoros\\normalizeServer()`,\n  to which it proxies.\n\n- [#307](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-diactoros/pull/307) deprecates `ServerRequestFactory::marshalHeaders()`; the method is\n  no longer used internally, and users should instead use `Zend\\Diactoros\\marshalHeadersFromSapi()`,\n  to which it proxies.\n\n- [#307](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-diactoros/pull/307) deprecates `ServerRequestFactory::marshalUriFromServer()`; the method\n  is no longer used internally. Users should use `marshalUriFromSapi()` instead.\n\n- [#307](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-diactoros/pull/307) deprecates `ServerRequestFactory::marshalRequestUri()`. the method is no longer\n  used internally, and currently proxies to `marshalUriFromSapi()`, pulling the\n  discovered path from the `Uri` instance returned by that function. Users\n  should use `marshalUriFromSapi()` instead.\n\n- [#307](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-diactoros/pull/307) deprecates `ServerRequestFactory::marshalHostAndPortFromHeaders()`; the method\n  is no longer used internally, and currently proxies to `marshalUriFromSapi()`,\n  pulling the discovered host and port from the `Uri` instance returned by that\n  function. Users should use `marshalUriFromSapi()` instead.\n\n- [#307](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-diactoros/pull/307) deprecates `ServerRequestFactory::getHeader()`; the method is no longer\n  used internally. Users should copy and paste the functionality into their own\n  applications if needed, or rely on headers from a fully-populated `Uri`\n  instance instead.\n\n- [#307](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-diactoros/pull/307) deprecates `ServerRequestFactory::stripQueryString()`; the method is no longer\n  used internally, and users can mimic the functionality via the expression\n  `$path = explode('?', $path, 2)[0];`.\n\n- [#307](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-diactoros/pull/307) deprecates `ServerRequestFactory::normalizeFiles()`; the functionality\n  is no longer used internally, and users can use `normalizeUploadedFiles()` as\n  a replacement.\n\n- [#303](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-diactoros/pull/303) deprecates `Zend\\Diactoros\\Response\\EmitterInterface` and its various implementations. These are now provided via the\n  [zendframework/zend-httphandlerrunner](https://docs.zendframework.com/zend-httphandlerrunner) package as 1:1 substitutions.\n\n- [#303](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-diactoros/pull/303) deprecates the `Zend\\Diactoros\\Server` class. Users are directed to the `RequestHandlerRunner` class from the\n  [zendframework/zend-httphandlerrunner](https://docs.zendframework.com/zend-httphandlerrunner) package as an alternative.\n\n### Removed\n\n- Nothing.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Nothing.\n\n",
