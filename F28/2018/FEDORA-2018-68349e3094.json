PHP open_basedir restrictions mitigate the effect of this flaw. For further details, see the PMASA announcement .\n\nA second flaw was also fixed allowing an attacker to use a specially crafted database name to trick a user in to executing a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack in the Designer feature .\n\nIn addition to the security fixes, this release also includes these bug fixes as part of our regular release cycle:\n\n* WHERE 0 clause causes a fatal error\n* Fix missing \"INDEX\" icon\n\n\n",
