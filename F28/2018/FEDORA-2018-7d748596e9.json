External URL injection through URL aliases - Moderately Critical - Open Redirect - Drupal 7 and Drupal 8\n\nThe path module allows users with the 'administer paths' to create pretty URLs for content.\n\nIn certain circumstances the user can enter a particular path that triggers an open redirect to a malicious url.\n\n3. Anonymous Open Redirect - Moderately Critical - Open Redirect - Drupal 8\n\nDrupal core and contributed modules frequently use a \"destination\" query string parameter in URLs to redirect users to a new destination after completing an action on the current page. Under certain circumstances, malicious users can use this parameter to construct a URL that will trick users into being redirected to a 3rd party website, thereby exposing the users to potential social engineering attacks.\n\n4. Injection in DefaultMailSystem::mail() - Critical - Remote Code Execution - Drupal 7 and Drupal 8\n\nWhen sending email some variables were not being sanitized for shell arguments, which could lead to remote code execution.\n\n5. Contextual Links validation - Critical - Remote Code Execution - Drupal 8\n\nThe Contextual Links module doesn't sufficiently validate the requested contextual links.\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role with the permission \"access contextual links\".\n\nExternal References:\n\nhttps://www.drupal.org/sa-core-2018-006"
