This broke our entire PDNS cluster this morning cause config parameters have changed and PDNS wasn't starting anymore. Also the Web API has changed. \n\nWe're running yum-cron to apply security patches automatically but this showed us to remove it from all systems.

It is a security update for https://doc.powerdns.com/authoritative/security-advisories/powerdns-advisory-2018-03.html (CVE-2018-10851). \n\nPlease let me explain a few things:  RHEL7 will be supported until June 30, 2024. We can't support PowerDNS 3.4.x until 2024, because PowerDNS 3.4.x is now EOL (End of Life).  Please check the End of life statement from upstream developer: https://doc.powerdns.com/authoritative/appendices/EOL.html\n\nThat's the reason why we must upgrade to PowerDNS 4.x. Since there is no SQL schema change between 3.4.x and 4.0.x the upgrade should work properly in most situations with mysql or psql backend. I am sorry that you had problems. Please note: The API was considered experimental in all 3.x releases.",
