These incompatibilities will prevent applications written for IDNA2003 to access certain problematic domain names defined with IDNA2008, e.g., faß.de is translated to domain xn--fa-hia.de with IDNA2008, while in IDNA2003 it is translated to fass.de domain. That not only causes incompatibility problems, but may be used as an attack vector to redirect users to different web sites.\n\nThe proposed change is about moving applications relying on IDNA2003, to the newer IDNA2008 standard (example: switch from libidn, which supports IDNA2003, and to libidn2 2.0.0, which supports IDNA2008). The switch should be transparent for the users.\n\nThis is part of the proposed change:\nhttps://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/IDNA2008"

These incompatibilities will prevent applications written for IDNA2003 to access certain problematic domain names defined with IDNA2008, e.g., faß.de is translated to domain xn--fa-hia.de with IDNA2008, while in IDNA2003 it is translated to fass.de domain. That not only causes incompatibility problems, but may be used as an attack vector to redirect users to different web sites.\n\nThe change is about deprecating libidn, which supports IDNA2003, and switch all applications using libidn, to libidn2 2.0.0, which supports IDNA2008. The switch should be transparent as the libidn2 library is API compatible. See instructions at:\nhttps://libidn.gitlab.io/libidn2/manual/libidn2.html#Converting-from-libidn\n\n\nThis is part of the IDNA2008 change:\nhttps://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/IDNA2008\n\nIf upstream is not aware of that change please involve them on the process."

(Shell meta-characters will still be disallowed.)  But there doesn't seem to be a good way to get that with current libidn2, unfortunately."

But I don't immediate see something that would cause this in the changes between -14 and -15. You pass -g as find_debuginfo_args which should do the right thing."
