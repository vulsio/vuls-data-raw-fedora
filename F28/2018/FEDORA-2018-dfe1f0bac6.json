There is no default path specified for the ssh command.  Due to that ssh is not used unless path to the command is explicitly configured, which can be done by adding 'set ssh-path /usr/bin/ssh' to /etc/c-client.cf configuration file, or to ~/.imaprc if support for user configuration files is enabled in the global system configuration.

Hence when the c-client attempts to execute rsh, the ssh is actually executed.  As noted above, there's no special configuration required for rsh to be executed, it only depends on the provided connection string.\n\nOn Red Hat Enterprise Linux, rsh can be executed if it is installed.
