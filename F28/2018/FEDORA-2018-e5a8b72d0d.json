An arbitrary file write vulnerability, that can be achieved using a specially crafted zip archive (affects other archives as well, bzip2, tar,xz, war, cpio, 7z), that holds path traversal filenames. So when the filename gets concatenated to the target extraction directory, the final path ends up outside of the target folder. Of course if an executable or a configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily. This affects multiple libraries that lacks of a high level APIs that provide the archive extraction functionality.\n\n\nReferences:\nhttps://snyk.io/research/zip-slip-vulnerability\n\nPatch:\nhttps://github.com/apache/hadoop/commit/745f203e577bacb35b042206db94615141fa5e6f#diff-19cfa944d1bb9ce1daa46aa4223f3642"

Since it was closed as NOTABUG, it implies that none of the issues blocking it are bugs.\n\nSecond, the CVE still isn't a proper CVE, but merely reserved as a placeholder, making it difficult to research whether this applies to any actual fedora product, and I'm not familiar enough with the issue to know if it's definitely a bug or just a possible bug.\n\nThird, it doesn't appear upstream was ever notified as it was never discussed on their mailing lists.\n\nFourth, the patch in the upstream git repo which has been alleged to fix this bug makes no such claim in its log message, and is simply identified as \"Additional checks\". There is no upstream bug tracker for this issue and no way to associate it with a CVE or any particular bug. There also seems to be an additional commit in other parts of the code that may be related, with a similar \"Additional checks\" log message.\n\nIt appears that the upstream patches have been applied to the not-yet-released 2.7.7 version, and 3.0.3 and I'm not sure about the latest 3.1.x or higher:\n\ngit clone git@github.com:apache/hadoop && cd hadoop\nfor x in $(git graph --no-color $(git ba | awk '{print $1}' | cut -c9- | grep origin)  | cat | grep 'Additional check when unpacking archives' | tr -d '|*' | cut -f1 -dA | grep -o '[^ ]*'); do git tag --contains $x | cat; done | sort -u\n\nWe can either backport the two upstream commits from 2.7.7 or we can wait until 2.7.7 is released and update from 2.7.6 to 2.7.7."
