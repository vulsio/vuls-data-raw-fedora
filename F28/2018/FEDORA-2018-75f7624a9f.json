It turns out that the same git binary package works with zlib-1.2.11-7.\n\nVersion-Release number of selected component (if applicable):\nzlib-1.2.11-8.fc28.aarch64\n\nHow reproducible:\nby building git, which executes tests in the %check phase, or using the simplified steps below, where\ncommit() {         echo \"$1\" >tracked &&         git add tracked &&         git commit -m \"$1\"; }\n\nFirst step of the reproducer can be done with the old version of zlib to show that the problematic code is executed only in the last step.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. mkdir t5538-push-shallow; cd t5538-push-shallow; git init .\n2. commit 1\n3. git repack\n4. dnf upgrade zlib-1.2.11-8\n5. git log --format=\"%s\"\n\nActual results:\n\n1 U\n\nExpected results:\n\n1\n\nAdditional info:\n\nThe U in the log output is garbage and the git test output show more examples of (mostly binary) garbage. Moreover, I built git without optimizations (-O0); I had suspected a compiler bug. It has the same problem, but the binary garbage printed by \"git log\" is sometimes different from an optimized build. This strongly suggests there is a bad memory access somewhere.\n\nHere is a ltrace output showing what does git call in zlib.\n\n$ ltrace -e @libz.so.1 git log --format=\"%s\" \nlibz.so.1->inflateInit2_(0xffffffc7b7a8, 15, 0xaaaab34461a8, 112 <unfinished ...>\nlibz.so.1->malloc(7160)                          = 0xaaaadf0d6740\nlibz.so.1->inflateReset2(0xffffffc7b7a8, 15, 7169, 0xaaaadf0d8330 <unfinished ...>\nlibz.so.1->inflateReset(0xffffffc7b7a8, 0, 0xffffbe580108, 0xffffc0cc <unfinished ...>\nlibz.so.1->inflateResetKeep(0xffffffc7b7a8, 0, 0xaaaadf0d6740, 0xffffc0cc) = 0\n<... inflateReset resumed> )                     = 0\n<... inflateReset2 resumed> )                    = 0\n<... inflateInit2_ resumed> )                    = 0\nlibz.so.1->adler32(0, 0, 0, 0 <unfinished ...>\nlibz.so.1->adler32_z(0, 0, 0, 0)                 = 1\n<... adler32 resumed> )                          = 1\nlibz.so.1->adler32(1, 0xaaaadf0d40a0, 218, 0 <unfinished ...>\nlibz.so.1->adler32_z(1, 0xaaaadf0d40a0, 218, 0)  = 0x709d4367\n<... adler32 resumed> )                          = 0x709d4367\nlibz.so.1->memset(0xaaaadf0d417a, 'U', 1)        = 0xaaaadf0d417a\nlibz.so.1->free(0xaaaadf0d6740)                  = <void>\n1 U\n--- SIGCHLD (Child exited) ---\nlibz.so.1->__cxa_finalize(0xffffbe59fac0, 0, 0xffffbe572510, 0) = 0xffffbe4f4fa8\n+++ exited (status 0) +++"

						"thetext": "So, I think I fully understand what is happening now. \"Bug\" is a bit strong, more a misinterpretation of whats allowed.\n\nSo git, in unpack_compressed_entry() is allocating a buffer of 'size' using xmallocz_gently() which actually allocates a slightly larger buffer and null terminates it. The code in unpack_compressed_entry() is utilizing this feature to go ahead and pass size+1 to zlib as the size of the buffer. To zlib it considers that it owns a buffer of size+1 and does a correct decompression (sets consumed/remaining sizes correctlt) but poisons the remainder of the buffer. \n\nThe zlib code then gets the return it expects and continues on its merry way not considering that the null may have been poisoned. Initially a quck hack to set the buffer passed to zlib as 'size' cleans up all the unit test failures, despite the fact that zlib is triggering an error case (which is ignored due to a successful return) due to the extra byte being consumed (AKA git's overconsumption check fails if the overconsumption is exactly 1 byte)."

That's certainly not ideal.\n\nInstead, I've applied Jeremy's packfile patch to aarch64 only.  Upstream has some questions about the patch, which can hopefully be resolved soon and the patch (or some version of it) can be accepted.\n\n(I wish I had seen the broken git builds in koschei when they showed up weeks ago.  I don't know if those failed builds didn't generate any notification or if I've disabled the notifications because they too frequently were due to transient issues.)\n\n¹ I've alerted the Red Hat security team so they can create tracking bugs for the issues"

Seeing that git was fairly well broken on aarch64 already, it's unlikely that it's going to be worse with the patch. :)\n\nSo far as I can tell, upstream is (rightly) concerned that the patch undoes a previous change to the deflate handling in packfile.c and wants to be sure that the fix isn't going to cause any regressions.  The tests suite still passes, including the test which was added at that time (in 39eea7bdd9 (\"Fix incorrect error check while reading deflated pack data\", 2009-10-21)).  That makes me think that even if the patch isn't the ideal fix, it's not going to cause problems.\n\nI only applied the current git patches on aarch64 and I don't have the update set to close this bug when the update goes stable."

From the [upstream announcement](https://public-inbox.org/git/xmqqy3g2flb6.fsf@gitster-ct.c.googlers.com/):\n\n```\n* Submodule \"names\" come from the untrusted .gitmodules file, but we\n  blindly append them to $GIT_DIR/modules to create our on-disk repo\n  paths. This means you can do bad things by putting \"../\" into the\n  name. We now enforce some rules for submodule names which will cause\n  Git to ignore these malicious names (CVE-2018-11235).\n\n  Credit for finding this vulnerability and the proof of concept from\n  which the test script was adapted goes to Etienne Stalmans.\n\n* It was possible to trick the code that sanity-checks paths on NTFS\n  into reading random piece of memory (CVE-2018-11233).\n```\n\nA preliminary patch to resolve an issue with zlib on aarch64 is also included (RHBZ#1582555).\n\n\n",
