Booting older kernels like 4.15.16-300.fc27.x86_64 or before, the brightness keys do work. So it must be a regression with a recent kernel update.\n\nVersion-Release number of selected component (if applicable):\n4.15.17-300.fc27.x86_64\n4.16.3-200.fc27.x86_64\n\nHow reproducible:\nReproducible every time. When I select a new kernel in grub, then the brightness keys never work. When I select an old kernel in grub, then the brightness keys always work.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Boot computer with new kernel\n2. Login\n3. Try the keyboard keys to increase/decrease screen brightness\n\nActual results:\nNothing happens, screen brightness stays fixed.\n\nExpected results:\nScreen gets brighter/darker.\n\nAdditional info:\nLaptop is about 5 years old, MSI, Intel Core i7-3630QM. Never had an issue with the screen brightness in old versions of fedora.\nThis issue severely impacts battery life and the possibility to work in very bright/dark environments."
