Typical speedups vs 2.6.0 is 10 to 40% depending on operation and key size.\n - Add Scrypt password hashing. Also supported is using Scrypt to derive keys for private key encryption (format compatible with upcoming OpenSSL 1.1.1)\n - Add base32 encoding/decoding\n - Plus many bug fixes and smaller enhancements documented in the [release notes](https://botan.randombit.net/news.html#version-2-7-0-2018-07-02)",
