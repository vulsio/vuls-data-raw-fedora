And while they were at it, they might as well have set up `sudo` to\nprovide priviledges for `beep`. The Fedora `beep` package even suggests that\nkind of setup in the commented out example configuration it ships in the file\n`/etc/sudoers.d/beep` and the text in `README.fedora`.\n\nI have no idea how many Fedora users might actually have set up `beep` to\ngain priviledges through `sudo`.\n\nSome people may have even set the `beep` executable setuid root. We neither\nsuggest or mention setuid root. `beep` does not refuse to run if\n`(geteuid() != getuid())` either, though. I have no idea how many people might\nbe affected here.\n\nI am not aware of other ways `beep` could be set up to gain priviledges than\n`sudo` or setuid root, so this concludes my summary on the impact of\nCVE-2018-1000532 on Fedora users."

So here comes that explanation.\n\nOld beep (before the beep-1.3-26.fc* packages) used the KIOCSOUND API, which\nworks on devices like /dev/tty[0-9]+. For that API, the kernel insists that\nyou are either root, or own the TTY. That caused the setuid and sudo based\nmethods to be used.\n\nThe kernel people have probably notice that issue many years ago and introduced\na better API: The evdev input device API. This uses the well-known device name\n/dev/input/by-path/platform-pcspkr-event-spkr which is a symlink to an input event\ndevice like e.g. /dev/input/event42. The system administrator can use normal file\npermissions to allow write access to /dev/input/by-path/platform-pcspkr-event-spkr\nwhich allows us to avoid the whole issue of being root.\n\nUnfortunately, old beep did not try /dev/input/by-path/platform-pcspkr-event-spkr\nby default - you had to explicitly give the device name on the command line!\n\nNew beep tries /dev/input/by-path/platform-pcspkr-event-spkr first. The new beep\npackages (beep-1.3-26.fc* and later) set up a \"beep\" group and allow group write\naccess for members of the beep group. This means being root is not required any\nmore for running beep.\n\nAlso, new beep aborts before doing anything if it detects being run setuid or\nvia sudo, so even if there are remaining sudo configurations, or someone makes\nbeep setuid-root by habit, beep will not do anything any more in those cases."
