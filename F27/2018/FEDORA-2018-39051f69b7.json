Patch0001 only deals with KRA-related stuff, but seems to be matching against code from that commit...\n\n--- Additional comment from Rob Crittenden on 2018-03-12 20:52:25 EET ---\n\nYou're right, I missed a patch. There were two issues, one hiding the other. I'll spin up a new build.\n\n--- Additional comment from Fedora Update System on 2018-03-13 16:15:06 EET ---\n\nfreeipa-4.6.3-3.fc27 has been submitted as an update to Fedora 27. https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2018-0a4399f314\n\n--- Additional comment from James Ettle on 2018-03-13 21:19:12 EET ---\n\nOK - 4.6.3-3.fc27.x86_64 updated cleanly. Server rebooted, confirmed login with OTP, NFS and web interface work. Thanks, Rob!\n\n--- Additional comment from Fedora Update System on 2018-03-14 03:39:18 EET ---\n\nfreeipa-4.6.3-3.fc27 has been pushed to the Fedora 27 testing repository.

One of the first steps of the plugin is to check if ca.is_configured(), which is equivalent to looking for a [pki-tomcatd] section in /var/lib/ipa/sysrestore/sysrestore.state. The plugin should be skipped when the CA is not configured, but the logs show that it gets executed.\n\nI asked the user to provide the sysrestore.state content, we'll be able to know more when we have this information available. Note: the logs confirm he's using IPA version 4.5.4-10.el7.centos."

It seems that these crashes don't actually cause anything the tests do to fail, so we hadn't noticed it before.\n\nThe service keeps starting up, crashing, then waiting a while (due to systemd service holdoff times), then starting again and crashing again. It crashes like this:\n\nAug 17 10:14:49 ipa001.domain.local systemd[1]: ipa-dnskeysyncd.service: Service hold-off time over, scheduling restart.\nAug 17 10:14:49 ipa001.domain.local systemd[1]: Stopped IPA key daemon.\nAug 17 10:14:49 ipa001.domain.local audit[1]: SERVICE_START pid=1 uid=0 auid=4294967295 ses=4294967295 subj=system_u:system_r:init_t:s0 msg='unit=ipa-dnskeysyncd comm=\"systemd>\nAug 17 10:14:49 ipa001.domain.local audit[1]: SERVICE_STOP pid=1 uid=0 auid=4294967295 ses=4294967295 subj=system_u:system_r:init_t:s0 msg='unit=ipa-dnskeysyncd comm=\"systemd\">\nAug 17 10:14:49 ipa001.domain.local systemd[1]: Started IPA key daemon.\nAug 17 10:14:49 ipa001.domain.local audit[1]: SERVICE_START pid=1 uid=0 auid=4294967295 ses=4294967295 subj=system_u:system_r:init_t:s0 msg='unit=ipa-dnskeysyncd comm=\"systemd>\nAug 17 10:14:50 ipa001.domain.local ipa-dnskeysyncd[8422]: Traceback (most recent call last):\nAug 17 10:14:50 ipa001.domain.local ipa-dnskeysyncd[8422]:   File \"/usr/libexec/ipa/ipa-dnskeysyncd\", line 28, in <module>\nAug 17 10:14:50 ipa001.domain.local ipa-dnskeysyncd[8422]:     api.finalize()\nAug 17 10:14:50 ipa001.domain.local ipa-dnskeysyncd[8422]:   File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ipalib/plugable.py\", line 738, in finalize\nAug 17 10:14:50 ipa001.domain.local ipa-dnskeysyncd[8422]:     self.__do_if_not_done('load_plugins')\nAug 17 10:14:50 ipa001.domain.local ipa-dnskeysyncd[8422]:   File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ipalib/plugable.py\", line 425, in __do_if_not_done\nAug 17 10:14:50 ipa001.domain.local ipa-dnskeysyncd[8422]:     getattr(self, name)()\nAug 17 10:14:50 ipa001.domain.local ipa-dnskeysyncd[8422]:   File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ipalib/plugable.py\", line 619, in load_plugins\nAug 17 10:14:50 ipa001.domain.local ipa-dnskeysyncd[8422]:     self.add_package(package)\nAug 17 10:14:50 ipa001.domain.local ipa-dnskeysyncd[8422]:   File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ipalib/plugable.py\", line 646, in add_package\nAug 17 10:14:50 ipa001.domain.local ipa-dnskeysyncd[8422]:     module = importlib.import_module(name)\nAug 17 10:14:50 ipa001.domain.local ipa-dnskeysyncd[8422]:   File \"/usr/lib64/python2.7/importlib/__init__.py\", line 37, in import_module\nAug 17 10:14:50 ipa001.domain.local ipa-dnskeysyncd[8422]:     __import__(name)\nAug 17 10:14:50 ipa001.domain.local ipa-dnskeysyncd[8422]:   File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ipaserver/plugins/certmap.py\", line 22, in <module>\nAug 17 10:14:50 ipa001.domain.local ipa-dnskeysyncd[8422]:     import dbus\nAug 17 10:14:50 ipa001.domain.local ipa-dnskeysyncd[8422]: ImportError: No module named dbus\n\nwhich looks a lot like a missing dependency on dbus-python, probably in python2-ipaserver, which is where /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ipaserver/plugins/certmap.py comes from.\n\nThis doesn't seem to be happening on F28 or newer. I think this may be because we never run this as Python 2 in F28+, and python3-ipaserver *does* have a dependency on python3-dbus. In F27 it seems both python3-ipaserver *and* python2-ipaserver get installed, and obviously there's still a Python 2 codepath that hits this bug."
