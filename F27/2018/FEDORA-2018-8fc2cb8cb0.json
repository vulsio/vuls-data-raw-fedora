This is related to missing filename validation in the wp-includes/post.php wp_delete_attachment function. The attacker must have capabilities for files and posts that are normally available only to the Author, Editor, and Administrator roles. The attack methodology is to delete wp-config.php and then launch a new installation process to increase the attacker's privileges.\n\nReferences:\n\nhttps://blog.ripstech.com/2018/wordpress-file-delete-to-code-execution/"
