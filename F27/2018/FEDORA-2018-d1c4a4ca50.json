However, this problem affects libmysqld - a library that can be used to embed MySQL server into other applications.  Such application, if only linked against libmysqld, can still open client connections to other MySQL servers using the MySQL client library code in libmysqld.  The problem is that such connections are silently established without TLS/SSL, even though application requested the library to establish TLS/SSL connection.\n\nNote that it's apparently possible to link an application to both libmysqlclient and libmysqld.  In that case, code from one of the libraries will be used, and the application may or may not be affected depending on the linking order."
