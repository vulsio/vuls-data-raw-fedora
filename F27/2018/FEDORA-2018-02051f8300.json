								"thetext": "\nThis release includes fixes for several high and medium severity security issues. It also contains a whole slew of bug fixes including the much awaited docker aufs whiteout file fix. It's a new release instead of a point release because it adds a new dependency to handle this bug, includes some new (albeit minor) feature enhancements, and changes the behavior of a few environment variables (see below).\n\nSingularity 2.5 should be installed immediately and all previous versions of Singularity should be removed. Many of the vulnerabilities fixed in this release are expected to affect all Linux distributions regardless of whether they implement overlayfs. There are no mitigations or workarounds for these issues outside of updating Singularity.\n\nAdditionally, Singularity 2.5 drops support for hosts that do not support the prctl() function PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS. The PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS feature was added to prctl() in the Linux 3.5 kernel. Various distributions have since backported this feature to currently maintained kernels (for example, Red Hat added this feature to RHEL 6.7 with the 2.6.32-504.16.2 kernel). Kernels that do not have this feature are inherently insecure in many ways. They do not implement container runtimes securely. Blocks have therefore been put in place to prevent Singularity 2.5 from building or running on vulnerable kernels.\n\nReferences:\n\nhttps://github.com/singularityware/singularity/releases"

However, in the Fedora / EPEL packaging guidelines, I can't offer much more than an informed opinion.  Steve Traylen, Brian Van Klaveren from SLAC, and I have offered to contribute as maintainers, which would allow us to help push out Fedora updates.\n\nI also would like an updated version of Singularity.  My prior comment was that the new version requested allow access to new capabilities and bugfixes; it does not contain security fixes for the release currently shipped by Fedora / EPEL.  It's a very important distinction, but doesn't indicate that I favor sticking with 2.3.x.\n\nAnyhow, the policy Dave Love is referring to is here:\n\nhttps://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL_incompatible_upgrades_policy\n\nAt least within the OSG support, we have slightly different workarounds for bugs in 2.2.x versus 2.3.x, but I haven't hit any compatibility problems with the core workflows in singularity 2.2.x.\n\nThe EPEL updates page says that major changes to the user experience are to be avoided but I'd argue:\na) The workflows existing in 2.2.x are relatively unchanged in 2.3.x (I'm sure one can find exceptions, of course...).\nb) Given the majority of the user community is not on 2.2.x -- and upstream Singularity project hasn't done further releases of 2.2.x, then an update is unavoidable.\n\nEven though the update policy gives security updates as examples of why one might make a big version jump within EPEL, it doesn't say that's the only reason.\n\nNow, in the other ticket, Dave Love does point out that there are a number of patches (19) currently applied to the Fedora build which are not currently in upstream releases.  It is real work to determine which are still relevant, which need to be upstreamed, and which can be simply dropped.  It seems that there was a prior issue with licensing of the Fedora patches (which explicitly list a different license than upstream's); it seems that upstream has changed their default license to plain BSD without the additional NOTICE statement.  Hopefully that will clear up one roadblock.\n\nBrian"

Anyone is welcome to have a differing opinion, but opinions and legal matters are distinct... Regardless, it seems a bit of a distraction.  The upstream weirdness in the LICENSE file is there no more and I don't recall signing any CCA.\n\nWith respect to bugs / patches -- I think the best way forward is to follow the patch guidelines and make sure we can provide a mapping between patches and an open bug in the upstream tracker.  That will help ease migrations to future versions, provide transparency about where the patches came from, and hopefully make future upstream releases better.  I didn't look through all 19, so I didn't get to the strncpy bug you reference - but I do agree that the /tmp handling is incorrect.\n\nHow would you like to divvy up the patch review work in order to work toward a new release?"
