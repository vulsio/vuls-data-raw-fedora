This means the packaged diff-highlight script won't be executable by default, which would be annoying. This might help:\n\n  chmod a+x contrib/diff-highlight/diff-highlight\n\nThat would mean git-core-doc would contain an executable, though.\n\nAnother possibility might be to put it /usr/libexec/git-core - perhaps in a new subdirectory, /usr/libexec/git-core/contrib, or even its own subdirectory of that, /usr/libexec/git-core/contrib/diff-highlight. Then it could be included in the git-core package."

						"thetext": "Hi Richard,\n\nI added diff-highlight in my local builds, which should eventually reach fedora.  You can test this COPR: https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/tmz/git/ (this is currently 2.17.0.rc0).\n\nThe commit adding this is on the devel branch of my git fork:\n\n    https://src.fedoraproject.org/fork/tmz/rpms/git/c/9bcb66d7\n\n> The only remaining problem is that the spec removes the executable bit from\n> every file in contrib. This means the packaged diff-highlight script won't\n> be executable by default, which would be annoying. This might help:\n> \n>   chmod a+x contrib/diff-highlight/diff-highlight\n> \n> That would mean git-core-doc would contain an executable, though.\n\nYeah, we explicitly remove the exec bit from files in the docs, to avoid the rpm dependency generators from pulling in unwanted requirements found in the example scripts.\n\n> Another possibility might be to put it /usr/libexec/git-core - perhaps in a\n> new subdirectory, /usr/libexec/git-core/contrib, or even its own\n> subdirectory of that, /usr/libexec/git-core/contrib/diff-highlight. Then it\n> could be included in the git-core package.\n\nWe also don't want any perl dependencies in git-core.  Removing the perl dependency was the initial motivation for splitting git-core from git. :)\n\nInstead, I've installed diff-highlight in /usr/share/git-core/contrib/diff-highlight.  I used /usr/share/git-core/contrib for two reasons: 1) diff-highlight is just a perl script, so /usr/share seems more appropriate, and 2) we already have other contrib bits under /usr/share/git-core.  I think that's a reasonable location (unless diff-highlight is rewritten in C and still left in contrib, which seems unlikely).\n\nIt could certainly fit in /usr/libexec/git-core/contrib as well, but that would mean adding another location for a contrib dir and I thought it seemed more likely to be a cause of confusion than it was worth.  (I could be wrong about all this.  But that was my thought process, in any case. ;) )\n\nThe documentation is still at /usr/share/doc/git/contrib/diff-highlight/README.  Adjusting the paths from the README, you can try out the diff-highlight program with:\n\n    git log -p --color | /usr/share/git-core/contrib/diff-highlight\n\nOr make it the default by setting pager.{diff,log,show} in .gitconfig, e.g.:\n\n    [pager]\n\t    log = /usr/share/git-core/contrib/diff-highlight | less\n\t    show = /usr/share/git-core/contrib/diff-highlight | less\n\t    diff = /usr/share/git-core/contrib/diff-highlight | less\n\nIf you can test this and let me know if you run into any issues, it would be most appreciated."

I think the choices you've made are fine. diff-highlight itself is in the git package, and its README is in git-core-doc.\n\nI did notice that git-core-doc also includes DiffHighlight.pm (i.e. it's not removed by the \"clean up to avoid cruft\" part of the spec), but that might have been intentional. Doesn't affect diff-highlight itself, though.\n\nWould it be possible to apply this change to the F27/F28 packages, as well as rawhide? I've cherry-picked your commit to the f27 branch (currently 2.14.3) and built git using mock; that too works fine.\n\nThanks a lot!"

That makes it easier for someone to discover, as that was split out of the script in order to allow others to re-use it.  I don't know if eventually it will end up installed in the perl-Git module tree or not.\n\nI've got 2.17.0-rc1 building for f28 now, as I intend to push that before f28 is released.  (It's just waiting on a really slow -- or hung -- ppc64le builder now.)\n\nI have been considering updating f27 to the current git release as well.  For a while we'd been keeping the same git release for an entire release, but I'm personally in favor of rebasing that at least every so often during a release cycle.  The git community does a very good job of not making breaking changes, so I think we'd be better off updating git in the current fedora releases to pick up the smaller bug fixes and improvements which don't get applied to a maintenance release.\n\nI have also been keeping a COPR for builds from the master/rawhide branch for EPEL and Fedora at https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/g/git-maint/git/.  I'll probably wait until 2.17.0 is final before updating that, which should be in the next few weeks."

From the [upstream announcement](https://public-inbox.org/git/xmqqy3g2flb6.fsf@gitster-ct.c.googlers.com/):\n\n```\n* Submodule \"names\" come from the untrusted .gitmodules file, but we\n  blindly append them to $GIT_DIR/modules to create our on-disk repo\n  paths. This means you can do bad things by putting \"../\" into the\n  name. We now enforce some rules for submodule names which will cause\n  Git to ignore these malicious names (CVE-2018-11235).\n\n  Credit for finding this vulnerability and the proof of concept from\n  which the test script was adapted goes to Etienne Stalmans.\n\n* It was possible to trick the code that sanity-checks paths on NTFS\n  into reading random piece of memory (CVE-2018-11233).\n```\n\nAlso fix a segfault in rev-parse with invalid input (#1581678) and install contrib/diff-highlight (#1550251).\n\n\n",
