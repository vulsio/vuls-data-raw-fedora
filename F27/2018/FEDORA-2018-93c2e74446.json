Unfortunately for me the working one does not work. I do not get any graphics support. Not even plain tty, so it's just uninitialized stuff on screen. Anyway no luck here and I'm positive it's not a config related issue, since I copied over anything I can think of affecting bus systems and hid drivers related to I2C and ELAN input.

It's as easy as compile, install reboot. It comes complete with working config. Very well done. I posted this in case someone stumbled upon this and for the kernel devs to check out a running version. Just to be clear: this is not an ubuntu based kernel. This kernel pretty much behaves just like a RHEL kernel. Including selinux.\nThe only downside was that I had to put in the original Realtek wifi adpter, since the kernel in the repo had no drivers for my newly bought intel chip on board. This would be a job for the future once I'm done celebrating hat my notebook is a self contained unit at last :D"
