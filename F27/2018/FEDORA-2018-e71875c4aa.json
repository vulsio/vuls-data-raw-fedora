Booting older kernels like 4.15.16-300.fc27.x86_64 or before, the brightness keys do work. So it must be a regression with a recent kernel update.\n\nVersion-Release number of selected component (if applicable):\n4.15.17-300.fc27.x86_64\n4.16.3-200.fc27.x86_64\n\nHow reproducible:\nReproducible every time. When I select a new kernel in grub, then the brightness keys never work. When I select an old kernel in grub, then the brightness keys always work.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Boot computer with new kernel\n2. Login\n3. Try the keyboard keys to increase/decrease screen brightness\n\nActual results:\nNothing happens, screen brightness stays fixed.\n\nExpected results:\nScreen gets brighter/darker.\n\nAdditional info:\nLaptop is about 5 years old, MSI, Intel Core i7-3630QM. Never had an issue with the screen brightness in old versions of fedora.\nThis issue severely impacts battery life and the possibility to work in very bright/dark environments."

It looks like it's now received some feedback and will need a bit of tweaking. I'm going to leave it out of the 4.16.5 build as well since it sounds like it may cause issues for nested virtualization. Hopefully it'll be resolved before 4.16.6. Sorry about that.",
