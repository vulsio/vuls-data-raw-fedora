However, this problem affects libmysqld - a library that can be used to embed MySQL server into other applications.  Such application, if only linked against libmysqld, can still open client connections to other MySQL servers using the MySQL client library code in libmysqld.  The problem is that such connections are silently established without TLS/SSL, even though application requested the library to establish TLS/SSL connection.\n\nNote that it's apparently possible to link an application to both libmysqlclient and libmysqld.  In that case, code from one of the libraries will be used, and the application may or may not be affected depending on the linking order."

In both cases, these are specified as command line arguments, which reduces impact of this flaw.  Victim would have to pass excessively long strings from an untrusted source to trigger the flaw.\n\nThe function is also used to escape identifier names obtained from the database server.  However, this problem should not be triggered when creating dumps from trusted servers even if untrusted users can create database or table names.  The limits on the length of those names (64 characters in most cases) are low enough to not trigger overflow."
