			"text": "Bug in my above suggested patch: The bro group needs to be added by bro-core not later if taking the capabilities approach there. Otherwise, ```/usr/bin/bro``` is set to ```root,root``` on machines that don't already have the bro group as the dependency relationship means broctl is installed after bro-core. All of the other files under the bro group and systemd service script are owned by the broctl package so this is a little awkward. I'm assuming here that chmoding the bro binary when broctl is installed would be frowned upon.",
