As stated in Case 01183581, our security regulations require us to enable DNSSEC validation in our DNS resolvers.\nHowever, the BIND versions in RedHat can only enable DNSSEC validation on a global level (for all queries - without exceptions). Unfortunately, some of our customer's internal domains will fail dnssec validation, because they use dns names that are not registered officially. Since we need access to these domains, we currently can not enable DNSSEC validation on our resolvers :(\n\nThe current bind911 version has more fine grained DNSSEC validation features, called \"negative trust anchors\" (see IETF RFC 7646). This would enable us to use finally enable DNSSEC for all queries, while we can still disable DNSSEC validation for specific domains known to be failing validation due to administrative error rather than because of a spoofing attack.\n\nThe new bind version would help us comply with our (and our customer's) compliance regulations and significantly raise the security level of the whole corporate network.\n~~~\n\nAdditional info:\nrpm -q bind --changelog  <--Doesnt show that \"RFC 7646\" is included in RHEL7 bind package\n\nsee IETF RFC 7646  --> https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7646"

After this I got no more of the above errors, for as long as the system was running.

It appears to me that this behavior is not configurable."

I restarted my system several times since, and did not observe this again, so the issue is probably void.\n\nAs to whether named should be allowed to write to /var/named, however, I still think that it should be. If it were not, it would be unable to create or delete .jnl files, for example. Also, the Bind9 ARM states this (in paragraph 6.2, p. 126): 'For this reason among others, the working directory should be always be writable by named'.\n\nRelocating zone files to another directory writable by named, say /var/named/dynamic, may be possible. However, such a configuration would not be any more secure than allowing write access to /var/named, or would it?"
