Thanks to Christian Elmer!\n- \\#1470: Fixed: Balloon Toolbar is not visible after drag and drop of a widget it is attached to.\n- \\#1048: Fixed: Balloon Panel is not positioned properly when a margin is added to its non-static parent.\n- \\#889: Fixed: Unclear error message for width and height fields in the Image and Enhanced Image plugins.\n- \\#859: Fixed: Cannot edit a link after a double-click on the text in the link.\n- \\#1013: Fixed: Paste from Word does not work correctly with the config.forcePasteAsPlainText option.\n- \\#1356: Fixed: Border parse function does not allow spaces in the color value.\n- \\#1010: Fixed: The CSS border shorthand property was incorrectly expanded ignoring the border-color style.\n- \\#1535: Fixed: Widget mouseover border contrast is insufficient.\n- \\#1516: Fixed: Fake selection allows removing content in read-only mode using the Backspace and Delete keys.\n- \\#1570: Fixed: Fake selection allows cutting content in read-only mode using the Ctrl/Cmd + X keys.\n- \\#1363: Fixed: Paste notification is unclear and it might confuse users.\n\n### API Changes\n\n- \\#1346: Balloon Toolbar context manager API is now available in the pluginDefinition.init method of the requiringplugin.\n- \\#1530: Added the possibility to use custom icons for buttons.\n\n### Other Changes\n\n- Updated SCAYT (Spell Check As You Type) and WebSpellChecker plugins:\n    - SCAYT scayt_minWordLength configuration option now defaults to 3 instead of 4.\n    - SCAYT default number of suggested words in the context menu changed to 3.\n    - \\#90: Fixed: Selection is lost on link creation if SCAYT highlights the word.\n    - Fixed: SCAYT crashes when the browser localStorage is disabled.\n    - [IE11] Fixed: Unable to get property type of undefined or null reference error in the browser console when SCAYT is disabled/enabled.\n    - \\#46: Fixed: Editing is blocked when remote spell checker server is offline.\n    - Fixed: User Dictionary cannot be created in WSC due to You already have the dictionary error.\n    - Fixed: Words with apostrophe ' on the replacement make the WSC dialog inaccessible.\n    - Fixed: SCAYT/WSC causes the Uncaught TypeError error in the browser console.\n- \\#1337: Updated the samples layout with the new CKEditor 4 logo and color scheme.\n- \\#1591: CKBuilder and language tools are now downloaded over HTTPS.
