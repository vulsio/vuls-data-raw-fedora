When large pages are in use for this\ntable, such an operation may incur a memory allocation (to replace a\nlarge mapping with individual smaller ones).  If this allocation\nfails, the p2m_set_entry() function will return an error.\n\nUnfortunately, several places in the populate-on-demand code don't\ncheck the return value of p2m_set_entry() to see if it succeeded.\n\nIn some cases, the operation was meant to remove an entry from the p2m\ntable.  If this removal fails, a malicious guest may engineer that the\npage be returned to the Xen free list, making it available to be\nallocated to another domain, while it retains a writable mapping to\nthe page.\n\nIn other cases, the operation was meant to remove special\npopulate-on-demand entries; if this removal fails, the internal\naccounting becomes inconsistent and may eventually hit a BUG().\n\nThe allocation involved comes from a separate pool of memory created\nwhen the domain is created; under normal operating conditions it never\nfails, but a malicious guest may be able to engineer situations where\nthis pool is exhausted.\n\nIMPACT\n======\n\nAn unprivileged guest can retain a writable mapping of freed memory.\nDepending on how this page is used, it could result in either an\ninformation leak, or full privilege escalation.\n\nAlternatively, an unprivileged guest can cause Xen to hit a BUG(),\ncausing a clean crash - ie, host-wide denial-of-service (DoS).\n\nVULNERABLE SYSTEMS\n==================\n\nAll systems from Xen 3.4 are vulnerable.\n\nOnly x86 systems are vulnerable.
