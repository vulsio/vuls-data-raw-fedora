If you would still like\nto see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version\nof Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora\nversion prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.\n\nAlthough we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's\nlifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a\nmore recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes\nbugs or makes them obsolete."

This vulnerability bug is used by the Product Security Team to track the vulnerability itself. Fixing of the issue in Fedora should be done in the tracking bug 1500016.\n\nThe thinking here is that the tracking bug blocks the vulnerability bug resolution and the vulnerability bug depends on the tracking bug :)"
