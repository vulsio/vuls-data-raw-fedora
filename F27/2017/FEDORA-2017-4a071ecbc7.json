However the affected code is NOT used at this time:\n\nCandlepin currently uses the default type resolution configuration for the ObjectMappers it creates/uses. Nowhere in candlepin do we enable global polymorphic deserialization via enableDefaultTyping(...), therefore based on the documentation sited BZ 1462702 , candlepin should not be affected.\n\nHowever as the vulnerable software ships with the product we have marked them as vulnerable to ensure the issue is tracked.\n\nJBoss EAP 7.x only uses the vulnerable Jackson Databind library for marshalling and unmarshalling of JSON objects passed to JAX-RS webservices. Some advise about how to remain safe when using JAX-RS webservices on JBoss EAP 7.x is available here: \n\nhttps://access.redhat.com/solutions/3279231"

However the affected code is NOT used at this time:\n\nCandlepin currently uses the default type resolution configuration for the ObjectMappers it creates/uses. Nowhere in candlepin do we enable global polymorphic deserialization via enableDefaultTyping(...), therefore based on the documentation sited BZ 1462702 , candlepin should not be affected.\n\nHowever as the vulnerable software ships with the product we have marked them as vulnerable to ensure the issue is tracked.\n\nJBoss EAP 7.x only uses the vulnerable Jackson Databind library for marshalling and unmarshalling of JSON objects passed to JAX-RS webservices. Some advise about how to remain safe when using JAX-RS webservices on JBoss EAP 7.x is available here: \n\nhttps://access.redhat.com/solutions/3279231"
