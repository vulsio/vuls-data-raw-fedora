Currently most F36 users probably also have snapd-2.56.2 since it was pushed to stable before being replaced with a lower version which fixes the CVEs (see  RH#2105619 ). Can you check the F36 version and do a build for that also if necessary? Thanks.",

Currently most F36 users probably also have snapd-2.56.2 since it was pushed to stable before being replaced with a lower version which fixes the CVEs (see  RH#2105619 ). Can you check the F36 version and do a build for that also if necessary? Thanks.",

Currently most F36 users probably also have snapd-2.56.2 since it was pushed to stable before being replaced with a lower version which fixes the CVEs (see  RH#2105619 ). Can you check the F36 version and do a build for that also if necessary? Thanks.",
