Additionally\nthe granularity of the grant table doesn't allow sharing less than a 4K page,\nleading to unrelated data residing in the same 4K page as data shared with a\nbackend being accessible by such backend (CVE-2022-33741, CVE-2022-33742).\n\nIMPACT\n======\n\nAn untrusted backend can access data not intended to be shared.

The\nsignaling of whether a frontend should consider a backend as potentially\nmalicious can be done from either the Linux kernel command line or the\ntoolstack.\n\nTwo different patches are provided for each Xen branch, but only the first\npatch will be applied to the official Xen repository for each branch.\n\nFor the xen-unstable branch patch 1 introduces a new field to the disk and nic\nconfigurations that allow signaling on a per-device basis whether the backend\nshould be trusted.  This is an ABI incompatible change, and cannot be applied\nto stable branches.  Patch 2 introduces support to libxl for\nlibxl_{disk,nic}_backend_untrusted environment variable to be used in order to\nset whether disk and network frontends should be trusted in the absence of a\nper-device setting.  Patch 2 is provided as a courtesy for users of stable\nbranches that might come to rely on this behavior.\n\nFor the stable branches (Xen 4.16.x - Xen 4.13.x) patch 1 introduces support to\nlibxl for libxl_{disk,nic}_backend_untrusted environment variable to be used in\norder to set whether disk and network backends should be trusted.  Patch 2\nreverts patch 1 and instead provides the more fine grained per-device options\nthat break the libxl ABI.\n\nNote that applying patch 2 to any of the stable releases will require a rebuild\nof any consumers of the libxl library, as it introduces an ABI breakage and\nhence won't be applied to the official repository stable branches.  Users of\nstable releases wanting to use the functionality provided by patch 2 will need\nto apply it manually.\n\nRegardless of the combinations of patches applied, in the absence of any\nenvironment variable mentioned above backends will be trusted by default.\n\nNote that patches for released versions are generally prepared to\napply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most\nrecent release tarball.
