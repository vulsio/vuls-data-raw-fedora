EPEL9 has 1.46.7, which should also be affected.\n\nIn general, grpc cannot be updated in stable releases—except for patch releases, e.g. 1.48.3 to 1.48.4—without significant fallout and an exception to the Updates Policy, because it does not offer ABI or even full API stability across minor releases. For Fedora 39/Rawhide, updating to a version of grpc that is not affected by this vulnerability is desirable, but is blocked by the transition to protobuf 4 (date-based versions 22.x, 23.x, etc, vs. 3.x). A huge number of packages will be affected by the breaking changes that entails, and it is not yet clear when that update can happen or what the impact will be. To the best of my knowledge, the version of grpc in Rawhide is the last version that can be built with protobuf 3. Therefore, an immediate fix by updating grpc to the latest version is not possible in Rawhide or in stable releases.\n\nAccording to the CVE, this requires upstream pull request https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/32309—the same one that fixes bug 2214470—as well as https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/33005. I plan to investigate whether or not the changes from these PR’s can be confidently backported to 1.48.4 and/or 1.46.7."

										"thetext": "An initial analysis follows:\n\nThe version of grpc packaged in all Fedora releases is 1.48.4; based on version number, it is affected by this vulnerability. EPEL9 has 1.46.7, which should also be affected.\n\nThe upstream commit that fixes the vulnerability is https://github.com/grpc/grpc/commit/2485fa94bd8a723e5c977d55a3ce10b301b437f8. Because some parts of the commit, such as the changes in src/core/ext/transport/chttp2/transport/hpack_parser.cc, touch code that was *added* after 1.48.4, I cannot confidently backport the fix to the older grpc version that is packaged.\n\nIn general, grpc cannot be updated in stable releases—except for patch releases, e.g. 1.48.3 to 1.48.4—without significant fallout and an exception to the Updates Policy, because it does not offer ABI or even full API stability across minor releases. Therefore, it will probably be impossible to patch this vulnerability in Fedora 37 and 38 and in EPEL9.\n\nFor Fedora 39/Rawhide, updating to a version of grpc that is not affected by this vulnerability is desirable, but is blocked by the transition to protobuf 4 (date-based versions 22.x, 23.x, etc, vs. 3.x). A huge number of packages will be affected by the breaking changes that entails, and it is not yet clear when that update can happen or what the impact will be. To the best of my knowledge, the version of grpc in Rawhide is the last version that can be built with protobuf 3.\n\nUnfortunately, that means there doesn’t appear to be much that I can do to mitigate this in the short term. I am setting the status to ASSIGNED to indicate I am tracking the issue, but please expect this issue to languish until a coordinated update of protobuf and grpc can be prepared."

This would be an ABI-incompatible upgrade.\n\nUnfortunately, upgrading to versions of grpc after 1.48.x is blocked by the need to transition system-wide to protobuf v4 (releases 22.x, 23.x, etc.). Quite a bit of work has been done, but very many dependent packages are affected, and so far nobody has had time to drive that update to completion, including all the necessary work to make dependent packages compatible[2].\n\nIn short, I’m happy to fix this by upgrading grpc, but I will not be able to do that in stable releases, and I will not be able to do it in development releases until the protobuf 4 work is done – which I have been helping with when I have a chance, but do not have time to drive to timely completion.\n\n[1] https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/grpc/pull-request/28\n[2] https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/protobuf/pull-request/25"

Could you please rerun the builds? The logs are no longer available in copr.\n\n[1] https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-j/8.0/en/connector-j-installing-maven.html"

I know grpc will need a simultaneous update, which is on my list to work on now that there is a buildable protobuf spec file to test against. However, I don’t think anyone has even begun the rest of the necessary impact check."
