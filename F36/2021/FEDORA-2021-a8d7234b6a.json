Libraries or tools that do not require user interaction are assumed to connect to trusted servers which would need to be compromised by an attacker first in order to trigger this vulnerability. In this last case, you'd have UI=N, but AC=H giving a CVSSv3.1 score of 5.9 that is lower than the current 6.5. For this reason we chose to evaluate the worst-case reasonable scenario.\n\n\nGiven the flaw is in the client side and it requires automatically connecting to a compromised but trusted server or manually connecting to a malicious server, the Impact of this flaw has been set to Low. It requires indeed unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited and when it is it is enough to stop the client or restart it."
