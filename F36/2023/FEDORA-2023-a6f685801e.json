This could help to figure out if the crash is related to installed SM extensions or something in your usual SM profile.\n\nIf it crashes on a clean profile, could you also check (on such a \"testing\" profile) whether it crahes on the generic Fedora/CentOS build (https://buc.fedorapeople.org/seamonkey/download/seamonkey-2.53.14-3.tar.xz) and on the official upstream build (http://archive.mozilla.org/pub/seamonkey/releases/2.53.14/linux-x86_64/de/seamonkey-2.53.14.de.linux-x86_64.tar.bz2). Both are build under CentOS-7, that way we can check if the crash is related to particular compiler, build and run environment etc.\n\nFor now, it is clean that the crash is triggered by an extra \"meta\" tag in langbar.html (note line 3 in the saved ./Lexmark_X544_files/langbar.html, and #13 of Thread 1 in the initial backtrace attached). What happens if you open this \"langbar.html\" directly (without any other activity in the browser session)?"

Fedora-35's one was 69.1, and the bundled \"generic\" and \"upstream\" ones are 63.1 .\n\nThe Firefox package (we're orienting on) has long since abandoned the system ICU library at all in favor of the bundled one (provided by the ordinary program source).  Apparently we should follow this behavior since now, and use the bundled ICU library, provided by the SeaMonkey upstream source.\n\nNew 2.53.15 version should appear soon, and I'll build it with the bundled ICU.

These tests can help determine if it is a compiler-specific issue (or some other build environment issue)."

I can only state whether the program crashed or not. Therefore, please check the f35 package again (including on your real printer).\n\nNote -- to install \"seamonkey-2.53.14-3.fc35\" under F37 environment, you need to install old libjxl, libvpx and libdav1d packages (since F37 already have new ones).
