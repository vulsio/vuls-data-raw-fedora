						"thetext": "ISSUE DESCRIPTION\n=================\n\nThe shadow pagetable code uses linear mappings to inspect and modify the\nshadow pagetables.  A linear mapping which points back to itself is known as\nself-linear.  For translated guests, the shadow linear mappings (being in a\nseparate address space) are not intended to be self-linear.  For\nnon-translated guests, the shadow linear mappings (being the same\naddress space) are intended to be self-linear.\n\nWhen constructing a monitor pagetable for Xen to run on a vcpu with, the shadow\nlinear slot is filled with a self-linear mapping, and for translated guests,\nshortly thereafter replaced with a non-self-linear mapping, when the guest's\n%cr3 is shadowed.\n\nHowever when writeable heuristics are used, the shadow mappings are used as\npart of shadowing %cr3, causing the heuristics to be applied to Xen's\npagetables, not the guest shadow pagetables.\n\nWhile investigating, it was also identified that PV auto-translate mode was\ninsecure.  This mode was removed in Xen 4.7 due to being unused, unmaintained\nand presumed broken.  We are not aware of any guest implementation of PV\nauto-translate mode.\n\nIMPACT\n======\n\nA malicious or buggy HVM guest may cause a hypervisor crash, resulting in a\nDenial of Service (DoS) affecting the entire host, or cause hypervisor memory\ncorruption.  We cannot rule out a guest being able to escalate its privilege.\n\nVULNERABLE SYSTEMS\n==================\n\nAll versions of Xen are vulnerable.\n\nHVM guests using shadow mode paging can exploit this vulnerability.\nHVM guests using Hardware Assisted Paging (HAP) as well as PV guests\ncannot exploit this vulnerability. guests cannot exploit the\nvulnerability.\n\nARM systems are not vulnerable.\n\nMITIGATION\n==========\n\nRunning only PV guests will avoid this vulnerability.\n\nWhere the HVM guest is explicitly configured to use shadow paging (eg\nvia the `hap=0' xl domain configuration file parameter), changing to\nHAP (eg by setting `hap=1') will avoid exposing the vulnerability to\nthose guests.  HAP is the default (in upstream Xen), where the\nhardware supports it; so this mitigation is only applicable if HAP has\nbeen disabled by configuration.\n\nExternal References:\n\nhttp://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-243.html"

In order to exclude simultaneous\nupdates to a given page by multiple parties, pages which are updated\nare locked beforehand.  This locking includes temporarily increasing\nthe type reference count by one.  When the page is later unlocked, the\ncontext precludes cleanup, so the reference that is then dropped must\nnot be the last one.  This was not properly enforced.\n\nIMPACT\n======\n\nA malicious or buggy PV guest may cause a memory leak upon shutdown\nof the guest, ultimately perhaps resulting in Denial of Service (DoS)\naffecting the entire host.\n\nVULNERABLE SYSTEMS\n==================\n\nAll Xen versions from 3.4 onwards are vulnerable.  Xen versions 3.3 and\nearlier are not vulnerable.\n\nOnly x86 systems are affected.  ARM systems are not affected.\n\nOnly x86 PV guests can leverage the vulnerability.  x86 HVM guests\ncannot leverage the vulnerability.\n\nMITIGATION\n==========\n\nRunning only HVM guests will avoid this vulnerability.\n\nFor PV guests, the vulnerability can be avoided if the guest kernel is\ncontrolled by the host rather than guest administrator, provided that\nfurther steps are taken to prevent the guest administrator from loading\ncode into the kernel (e.g. by disabling loadable modules etc) or from\nusing other mechanisms which allow them to run code at kernel privilege.\n\nExternal References:\n\nhttp://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-242.html"

								"thetext": "ISSUE DESCRIPTION\n=================\n\nThe shadow pagetable code uses linear mappings to inspect and modify the\nshadow pagetables.  A linear mapping which points back to itself is known as\nself-linear.  For translated guests, the shadow linear mappings (being in a\nseparate address space) are not intended to be self-linear.  For\nnon-translated guests, the shadow linear mappings (being the same\naddress space) are intended to be self-linear.\n\nWhen constructing a monitor pagetable for Xen to run on a vcpu with, the shadow\nlinear slot is filled with a self-linear mapping, and for translated guests,\nshortly thereafter replaced with a non-self-linear mapping, when the guest's\n%cr3 is shadowed.\n\nHowever when writeable heuristics are used, the shadow mappings are used as\npart of shadowing %cr3, causing the heuristics to be applied to Xen's\npagetables, not the guest shadow pagetables.\n\nWhile investigating, it was also identified that PV auto-translate mode was\ninsecure.  This mode was removed in Xen 4.7 due to being unused, unmaintained\nand presumed broken.  We are not aware of any guest implementation of PV\nauto-translate mode.\n\nIMPACT\n======\n\nA malicious or buggy HVM guest may cause a hypervisor crash, resulting in a\nDenial of Service (DoS) affecting the entire host, or cause hypervisor memory\ncorruption.  We cannot rule out a guest being able to escalate its privilege.\n\nVULNERABLE SYSTEMS\n==================\n\nAll versions of Xen are vulnerable.\n\nHVM guests using shadow mode paging can exploit this vulnerability.\nHVM guests using Hardware Assisted Paging (HAP) as well as PV guests\ncannot exploit this vulnerability. guests cannot exploit the\nvulnerability.\n\nARM systems are not vulnerable.\n\nMITIGATION\n==========\n\nRunning only PV guests will avoid this vulnerability.\n\nWhere the HVM guest is explicitly configured to use shadow paging (eg\nvia the `hap=0' xl domain configuration file parameter), changing to\nHAP (eg by setting `hap=1') will avoid exposing the vulnerability to\nthose guests.  HAP is the default (in upstream Xen), where the\nhardware supports it; so this mitigation is only applicable if HAP has\nbeen disabled by configuration.\n\nExternal References:\n\nhttp://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-243.html"

								"thetext": "ISSUE DESCRIPTION\n=================\n\nThe x86-64 architecture allows interrupts to be run on distinct stacks.\nThe choice of stack is encoded in a field of the corresponding\ninterrupt descriptor in the Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT).  That\nfield selects an entry from the active Task State Segment (TSS).\n\nSince, on AMD hardware, Xen switches to an HVM guest's TSS before\nactually entering the guest, with the Global Interrupt Flag still set,\nthe selectors in the IDT entry are switched when guest context is\nloaded/unloaded.\n\nWhen a new CPU is brought online, its IDT is copied from CPU0's IDT,\nincluding those selector fields.  If CPU0 happens at that moment to be\nin HVM context, wrong values for those IDT fields would be installed\nfor the new CPU.  If the first guest vCPU to be run on that CPU\nbelongs to a PV guest, it will then have the ability to escalate its\nprivilege or crash the hypervisor.\n\nIMPACT\n======\n\nA malicious or buggy x86 PV guest could escalate its privileges or\ncrash the hypervisor.\n\nVULNERABLE SYSTEMS\n==================\n\nAll Xen versions from at least 3.2 onwards are vulnerable.  Earlier\nversions have not been checked.\n\nOnly PV guests can exploit the vulnerability.  HVM guests cannot\nexploit the vulnerability, but their presence is necessary for the\nexposure of the vulnerability to PV guests.\n\nOnly x86 systems using SVM (AMD virtualisation extensions) rather than\nVMX (Intel virtualisation extensions) are vulnerable.  Therefore AMD\nx86 hardware is vulnerable; Intel hardware is not vulnerable.\n\nARM systems are not vulnerable.\n\nMITIGATION\n==========\n\nAvoiding to online CPUs at runtime will avoid this vulnerability.\n\nRunning only HVM or only PV guests on any individual host will also\navoid this vulnerability.\n\nExternal References:\n\nhttp://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-244.html"
