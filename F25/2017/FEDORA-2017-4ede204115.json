Hence we decided to immediately make this bug public and don't aim for a coordinated release date. So please make this bug public as well.\n\nDetails are on the linked Launchpad bug.\n\nCVE-2015-1326\nUpstream fix: https://github.com/martinpitt/python-dbusmock/commit/4e7d0df9093\nThis is included in the 0.15.1 upstream release: https://launchpad.net/python-dbusmock/trunk/0.15.1"
