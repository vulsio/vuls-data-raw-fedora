However, if the software ignored that topmost part of the chain, the software should be able to create a different chain, based on an earlier intermediate sent in the chain, which points to \"GeoTrust Global CA\".\n\nI think we shouldn't change our plans, we should continue with the plan to disable all legacy CAs in Fedora 25.\n\nHow can we get the developers of this software to change their code? They shouldn't use their own implementation of certificate validation, but use one provided by the libraries (by GnuTLS, if that's what they use), which already is finding potentially shorter and working chains of trust."
