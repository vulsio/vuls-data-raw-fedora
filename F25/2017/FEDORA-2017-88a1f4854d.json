Instead, SSSD gets the password from the user and tries it against the authentication source. If it succeeds, SSSD will salt and hash the successful password and store it locally.\n\nSo the only passwords that could be leaked are from those who have previously performed a successful login on the local system.\n\nAlso note that switching to `cache_credentials = False` is insufficient to mitigate this, as it will not remove the existing cached credentials from the system; it will only stop new ones from being added to the cache. If you want to purge the cache, you must remove the cache file (I don't think the `sss_cache` tool can eliminate the cached credentials today, but that might be a good RFE for the future)."

Instead, SSSD gets the password from the user and tries it against the authentication source. If it succeeds, SSSD will salt and hash the successful password and store it locally.\n\nSo the only passwords that could be leaked are from those who have previously performed a successful login on the local system.\n\nAlso note that switching to `cache_credentials = False` is insufficient to mitigate this, as it will not remove the existing cached credentials from the system; it will only stop new ones from being added to the cache. If you want to purge the cache, you must remove the cache file (I don't think the `sss_cache` tool can eliminate the cached credentials today, but that might be a good RFE for the future)."
