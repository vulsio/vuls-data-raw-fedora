It may give us a hint as to what is going wrong with the build. Right now, I have no idea what the makefile is doing behind the scenes.\n\n> This happens because upstream project change it's structure too often and in \n> very unpredictable way.

The only potentially user-visible change in -2 (compared to -1) is the fixed unbundling, which you did not even mention in the changelog and the update notes. Adding a comment to the specfile and enabling verbose build outputs are things that can make your package more compliant to the packaging guidelines, but what is the point of pushing a Bodhi update for that? On the other hand, -4 enables the -debuginfo subpackage again, which is user-visible, even if the size issue is still there."

I think this is understandable.  That's why I've disabled debuginfo. I don't remember the reason of removing of rm -rf thirdparty libraries directory maybe it's was too late and I wanted to go to bed :) \nAs we're on branching time right now I'm trying to fix all FTBFS bugs assigned to me to keep packages in the release. GCC7 brought many cakes for me and I have to eat them all. \nI really appreciate your comments and help to make the package better and I use mupdf on daily basis.
