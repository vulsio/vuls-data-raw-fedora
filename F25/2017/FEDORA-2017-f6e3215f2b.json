If you would still like\nto see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version\nof Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora\nversion prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.\n\nAlthough we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's\nlifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events.
