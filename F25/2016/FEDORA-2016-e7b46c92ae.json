								"thetext": "== Analysis from Jakub Martisko == \n\nDuring the first phase (where the program identifies starts and ends of the blocks), blockEnd of the first block is set to be blockStart-1. Similarly for block 3. During the second phase, the first block is ignored (it is not long enough), the second block is recovered correctly and the third one leads to crash. The cause of crash is, that because the end of this block is set to be one bit before its start, it tries to write the end stream sequence (sqrt(PI)....), however since it writes its end before the start, no file is opened and this leads to crash. Problem is, that after closing the output file, the second block does not set variable \"outFile\" to NULL. Third block then checks this variable and because it is not NULL, it tries to write to the output stream, which was closed with bsClose(). As for the fix, it seems to be enough to add \"outFile=NULL;\" to the end of block that is responsible for creation of the end of stream sequence (patch attached)."
