Initially, both of them are the same, but after key re-exchange, previous `session_id` is kept and used as an input to new `secret_hash`. Historically, both of these buffers had shared length variable, which worked as long as these buffers were same. But the key re-exchange operation can also change the key exchange method, which can be based on hash of different size, eventually creating `secret_hash` of different size than the `session_id` has. This becomes an issue when the `session_id` memory is zeroized or when it is used again during second key re-exchange."
