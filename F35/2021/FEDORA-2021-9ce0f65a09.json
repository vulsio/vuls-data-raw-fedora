On line 106673, it restores the ld.so symbolic link to the old (pre-downgrade) version, and then proceeds to delete that ld.so version on line 138684.  (This is with rpm-4.14.2.1-3.fc30.x86_64 in the chroot.)\n\nSolving this completely is not easy because RPM performs some file system updates very late in the transaction.  Files deleted during the transaction stay around for a long time, and if ldconfig is executed by a scriptlet, it will break things during glibc downgrades."

Not all of them use /lib64 paths, which makes /lib a more natural choice in some ways.\n\nI believe the System V psABI supplement for AArch64 has not yet been published. There are various ELF-related AArch64 specifications, but they equally apply to embedded scenarios. They do not specify Linux-specific aspects such as the ELF interpreter name or the minimum and maximum page size."
