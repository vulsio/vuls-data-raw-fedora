I even applied the patch to the seccomp policy that Razvan recommended[1], but I still face the same issue. This[2] is the commit where I added a step to patch the seccomp policy to the workflow files in my Containerfiles Github repo. Following Razvan's advice on a regular Ubuntu 20.04 VM with Docker from the Docker CE repository did fix the problem, however. Github Actions actually uses a completely different version of Docker that is neither from the Docker CE repo nor the regular Ubuntu repo. Instead, Github Actions installs `moby-engine` from this apt repository [3] that Microsoft operates. Here [4,5] are the relevant scripts in the repository that holds the configuration for the Github Actions runner VM images.\n\nI have not done extensive debugging, yet, but I have some ideas. One thing that I noticed is that the Github Actions runners have version `20.10.7+azure` of Docker [6] instead of the latest version `20.10.8`. Could that be the problem? The new version is present in the Microsoft apt repository [7], though; Github just hasn't updated `moby-engine` in the runner images, yet.\n\nIn the meantime, does it make sense to file a bug report upstream (with Docker)?\n\nThanks,\nMaxwell\n\n[1]: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1988199#c3\n[2]: https://github.com/gotmax23/Containerfiles/commit/f77828d3c7255a555f360ce546a09dd9711550c3\n[3]: https://packages.microsoft.com/ubuntu/20.04/prod\n[4]: https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments/blob/main/images/linux/scripts/base/repos.sh (Sets up repository)\n[5]: https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments/blob/main/images/linux/scripts/installers/docker-moby.sh (Installs Docker)\n[6]: https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments/blob/main/images/linux/Ubuntu2004-README.md#tools\n[7]: https://packages.microsoft.com/ubuntu/20.04/prod/pool/main/m/moby-engine/"

						"thetext": "I just tested Docker Buildx with the `moby-engine` package on Fedora and it worked! I had to install the Docker Buildx binary manually, because it isn't packaged in Fedora's repos. I also had to set SElinux to permissive mode, as there were a bunch of SElinux denials that I'm not knowledgeable enough to fix. It doesn't require making any changes to the seccomp policy, either. It seems there are two problems that we need to fix for this to work with other versions of Docker:\n\n1. The default seccomp profile needs to be patched as Razvan explained.\n2. Docker Buildx is not honoring the `seccomp-profile` directive in `/etc/docker/daemon.json. Adding `--security-opt seccomp=/etc/docker/seccomp.json` to the `docker buildx build` command does not work either. It seems that the only reason Docker Buildx works on Fedora to begin with is that we don't need to patch the seccomp profile at all.\n\nFedora 34's `moby-engine` packages works because it is not at the latest version. I just tested the new update that the package maintainer submitted to Bodhi[1] and it now has that same issue. As I commented on Bodhi, it seems that this[2] is the problematic commit. Razvan's patch reverts part of that commit.\n\n[1]: https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2021-1437ef97e1\n[2]: https://github.com/moby/moby/commit/9f6b562dd12ef7b1f9e2f8e6f2ab6477790a6594#diff-ae1c2d16350cc6adbb1802390cbd195657d5562dd804e0dcc62607213a186c2b"

						"thetext": "Description of problem:\n\ndocker build fails, and containers started with docker run fail to fork child processes.  Both are probably caused by the use of the clone3 syscall from the container being blocked by the seccomp mechanism.\n\nUpstream moby (looking at https://github.com/moby/moby) has added bits to allow clone3, that I don't see in the moby-engine package in fedora 35.  So it may just be a matter of updating to a more recent version of upstream.\n\nThis is similar and related to a few other bugs (1990469, 1992708), but in this case both the host and container image are fedora 35.\n\nWhen using \"docker run\", this can be worked around by either running unconfined (seccomp=unconfined), or by using a custom profile, such as the one that's provided by containers-common (/usr/share/containers/seccomp.json) which allows clone3.  But I'm not sure how this can be worked around when using \"docker build\".\n\n\nVersion-Release number of selected component (if applicable):\n\nmoby-engine-20.10.8-1.fc35.x86_64\n\n\nHow reproducible:\n\nConsistently reproduces.\n\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\n1.
