This is difficult on the Internet, but can be a plausible attacker model on the local network. The more dangerous variation of this attack requires the victim to use Microsoft Internet explorer and therefore Linux users are generally not vulnerable to them.\n\nHow the attack works: \n\nThe ALPACA attack is only possible because TLS does not protect the source or destination IP and port address of the TCP connection. As is stated in the TLS RFC, TLS is application layer independent. However, this gap in protection gives the attacker the flexibility to redirect traffic from one server to another, making the cross-protocol attack possible.\n\nBasic idea behind application layer cross-protocol attacks on HTTPS. A MitM attacker leads the victim to an attacker-controlled website that triggers a cross-origin HTTPS request with a specially crafted FTP payload.  The attacker then redirects the request to an FTP server that has a certificate compatible with the web server. The attack either (1) uploads a secret cookie to FTP, or (2) downloads a stored malicious JavaScript file from FTP, or (3) reflects malicious JavaScript contained in the request. In case (2) and (3), the JavaScript code is executed in the context of the targeted web service.\n\nConditions required for the attack to work:\n\n1. As per mentioned above you need a MiTM atack who can divert victim's traffic at the TCP/IP layer and therefore the only plausible attack model is on the local network.\n\n2. If you are hosting several TLS-enabled application servers on the same hostname, or if you use multi-domain certificates, or if you use wild-card certificates, you may be vulnerable to the general confusion attack."
