						"thetext": "I am the maintainer of the “stb” package in Fedora and in EPEL.\n\nThe separate stb package in Fedora (and EPEL8 and EPEL7) is only a couple of months old, and the oldest packaged stb_image version was 2.27. Nevertheless, the initial packaged version was affected by this CVE, as explained in the following paragraph.\n\nThe CVE text claims the latest affected version is 2.26, but this is not quite right. The upstream fix in https://github.com/nothings/stb/commit/5ba0baaa269b3fd681828e0e3b3ac0f1472eaf40 came after the bump to stb_image 2.27 in https://github.com/nothings/stb/commit/3a7dcdd2696ed7b85f892f951b0801e382b81778—so even though the “stb” package has never contained stb_image 2.26 or earlier, the initial package *was* affected by the CVE, and the current version *is not* affected, even though both provide stb_image 2.27. Is that confusing enough?\n\nThe following are the Bodhi updates (each already in stable) in which the CVE was corrected.\n\nF36: https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2021-35ace22099\nF35: https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2021-f049bf1e9a\nF34: https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2021-91a1112a15\nF33: https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2021-7251e0ffa8\nEPEL8: https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-EPEL-2021-a3ef29c6c4\nEPEL7: https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-EPEL-2021-def1471d2b\n\nAccordingly, there is no need for a further update to the stb package in response to this issue.\n\nSince stb_image is a header-only library, fully eradicating vulnerable code associated with the “stb” package would require rebuilding any package that depends on “stb_image-devel” and/or “stb_image-static”.\n\nFurthermore, since stb libraries are designed for bundling, it is likely that vulnerable versions do remain bundled with other packages in the distribution—either properly marked with “Provides: bundled(stb_image) = […]”, or, quite commonly, undetected. Wherever possible, I suggest migrating any such packages to use the unbundled stb_image-devel/stb_image-static provided here. I’m happy to assist with any such efforts upon request.\n\nPlease let me know if there is anything I can do."

So it would be misleading to state that the \"fixed version\" is 2.27 because there are 2.27s floating around out there that are also vulnerable? Is this a fair statement?"
