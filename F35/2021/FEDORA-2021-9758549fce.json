The last 2 directories and file name of the path are chosen randomly by Synapse and cannot be controlled by an attacker, which limits the impact. Homeservers with the media repository disabled are unaffected. Homeservers with a federation whitelist are also unaffected, since Synapse will check the remote hostname, including the trailing `../`s, against the whitelist. Server administrators should upgrade to 1.47.1 or later. Server administrators using a reverse proxy could, at the expense of losing media functionality, may block the certain endpoints as a workaround. Alternatively, non-containerized deployments can be adapted to use the hardened systemd config.\n\nReference:\n\nhttps://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.47.1\nhttps://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-3hfw-x7gx-437c\nhttps://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/commit/91f2bd090"

An attacker could cause these Synapses to download a remote file and store it in a directory outside the media repository.\n\nNote that:\n\n    This only affects homeservers using Synapse's built-in media repository, as opposed to synapse-s3-storage-provider or matrix-media-repo.\n    Attackers cannot control the exact name or destination of the stored file.\n\nTo quote from the advisory:\n\nGHSA-3hfw-x7gx-437c / CVE-2021-41281: Path traversal when downloading remote media.\n\n    Impact\n\n    Synapse instances with the media repository enabled can be tricked into downloading a file from a remote server into an arbitrary directory, potentially outside the media store directory.\n\n    The last two directories and file name of the path are chosen randomly by Synapse and cannot be controlled by an attacker, which limits the impact.\n\n    Homeservers with the media repository disabled are unaffected. Homeservers configured with a federation whitelist are also unaffected.\n\nThe advisory has full details, including workarounds.\n\nThis issue was discovered and fixed by our internal security team.\n\nPlease update at your earliest convenience."
