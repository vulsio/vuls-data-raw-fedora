						"thetext": "Created attachment 1748614\nVulnerability trigger - PoC\n\nDescription of problem:\nA heap memory corruption problem (use after free) can be triggered in libgetdata v0.10.0 when processing maliciously crafted dirfile databases. This degrades the confidentiality, integrity and availability of third-party software that uses libgetdata as a library. This vulnerability may lead to arbitrary code execution or privilege escalation depending on input/skills of attacker.\n\nVersion-Release number of selected component (if applicable):\ngetdata v0.10.0\n\nHow reproducible:\nAlways\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nVulnerability can be tested by supplying a malcrafted database file to the libgetdata library. In Ubuntu Linux, the checkdirfile utility is also vulnerable, this utility is installed by default by the getdata package.\nIn Fedora linux, this is located at: /usr/bin/checkdirfile\n\nTo test the vulnerability, pass a directory path containing a malcrafted FORMAT dirfile database to checkdirfile, as follows:\n\ncheckdirfile /path/to/dirfile-db/directory/\n\nAttached is a sample malformed database with a screenshot of the memory analysis.\n\nNOTE: For better visibility of the stack, compile the library with ASAN sanitizer.\n\nActual results:\nCrash + Coredump\n\nExpected results:\nProgram should display an error and continue/exit depending on context\n\nAdditional info:\n\nWhen a RAW field specification is used with a duplicated field name in a FORMAT database fragment, the field name will be freed by _GD_ParseFieldSpec() in parse.c, but later referenced by _GD_Supports() in encoding.c when figuring out the encoding type of the RAW frames.\n\nTested on Fedora 33 and 32"
