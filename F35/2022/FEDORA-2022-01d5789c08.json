And for us this is a low priority issue, because we'll fix it with a rebase when the fix is released upstream.\nSo we set the Priority to low to indicate that, and to properly categorise it for our triage meetings. Let me try setting it again. Do you see any reason why ProdSec would need to overwrite our setting of the Priority of this BZ?"
