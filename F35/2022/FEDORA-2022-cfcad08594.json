([#1312](https://github.com/httpie/httpie/pull/1312))\n- Fixed escaping of integer indexes with multiple backslashes in the nested JSON builder. ([#1285](https://github.com/httpie/httpie/issues/1285))\n- Fixed displaying of status code without a status message on non-`auto` themes. ([#1300](https://github.com/httpie/httpie/issues/1300))\n- Fixed redundant issuance of stdin detection warnings on some rare cases due to underlying implementation. ([#1303](https://github.com/httpie/httpie/pull/1303))\n- Fixed double `--quiet` so that it will now suppress all python level warnings. ([#1271](https://github.com/httpie/httpie/issues/1271))\n- Added support for specifying certificate private key passphrases through `--cert-key-pass` and prompts. ([#946](https://github.com/httpie/httpie/issues/946))\n- Added `httpie cli export-args` command for exposing the parser specification for the `http`/`https` commands. ([#1293](https://github.com/httpie/httpie/pull/1293))\n- Improved regulation of top-level arrays. ([#1292](https://github.com/httpie/httpie/commit/225dccb2186f14f871695b6c4e0bfbcdb2e3aa28))\n- Improved UI layout for standalone invocations. ([#1296](https://github.com/httpie/httpie/pull/1296))\n",
