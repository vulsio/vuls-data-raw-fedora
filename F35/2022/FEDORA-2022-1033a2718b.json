								"thetext": "1) About Rencode\nRencode is a \"Python module for fast (basic) object serialization\nsimilar to bencode\".\nhttps://github.com/aresch/rencode\nThis library is used as a faster and more efficient data encoder than\nbencode.\nThere are implementations in other languages: Golang, Javascript, Java,\nRuby, dart, etc\nSome of these ports carry the same bug, the Go port does.\n(as an aside - not all of these derived works have preserved the\noriginal copyright and license)\n\n2) Vulnerability\nhttps://github.com/aresch/rencode/pull/29\nGiven malformed input, the rencode parser enters an infinite loop.\nThe shortest rencoded string to trigger this bug is ';\\x2f\\x7f' but\nthere is an infinite number of possibilities.\nAlthough the library is accelerated in Cython, it cannot release the\nglobal interpreter lock so the Python interpreter process is irreparably\nlocked up once the loop is entered.\nThe software becomes unresponsive and consumes CPU until the process\nruns out of memory and is terminated - which can take a *very* long time.\n\n3) Affected software\nThere are at least two active open-source network facing projects using\nthe vulnerable python rencode library in their transport layer: xpra and\ndeluge.\nXpra is a remote desktop access tool - aka \"screen for X11\" and Deluge\nis a bittorrent client.\nThere are other programs out there using this library but they are less\nprominent or not network facing, though there may well be more\nvulnerable software written in other languages.\n\n4) Example DoS against xpra\nXpra uses rencode for structured messages between its processes,\ntypically between clients and servers.\nGiven an xpra process listening on a TCP port, sending this tiny (11\nbytes) malformed packet triggers the DoS:\n'P\\x01\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x03;/\\x7f'\nThis does not require any authentication.\nSome packaged installations create a system wide proxy server which runs\nas root and listens on the IANA assigned TCP port 14500.\nOther socket types don't make it any harder to trigger (ie: websockets,\nSSL), only requiring extra packet encapsulation.\nLocal users may also have access to other user's unix domain sockets.\n\n5) Mitigation\nThe easiest way is to remove the Cython accelerated version of rencode:\nrm `python3 -c \"from rencode import _rencode;print(_rencode.__file__)\"`\nAs the pure Python fallback implementation does not have this bug.\n\n6) Disclosure timeline\n2021-08-05 bug discovered, fix provided\n2021-08-06 requested a CVE from mitre\n2021-08-10 fix applied in rencode\n2021-09-07 disclosure\n\nReferences:\n\nhttps://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2021/Sep/16\nhttps://github.com/aresch/rencode/pull/29"
