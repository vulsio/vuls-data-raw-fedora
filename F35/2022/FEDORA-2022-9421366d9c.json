If glibc now assumes that authselect takes over the ownership, it must grow a Requires: authselect, or it must not remove the file on upgrades.\n\nVersion-Release number of selected component (if applicable):\n\nglibc 2.34.9000-31.fc36\n\nThis always happens on fedora-rawhide packit tests now, but I have only quickly tried to reproduce it with a simple \"dnf update\", and that did not remove the file. So the conditions under which this happens are a bit more subtle apparently. I'll try to find a reproducer tomorrow, but the cause already seems quite clear?\n\nAdditional info:\n\n[1] http://artifacts.dev.testing-farm.io/f4046164-3cb6-4662-89b2-b8e47b39b1cb//work-allJOfFfz/log.txt"

This kind of dependency cycle probably has a lot of unwanted side effects. There must be a better way to pull in authselect. On the other hand, it could be a one of these cases where it is just very hard to support partial rawhide upgrades.\n\n(I definitely want to change the glibc default.)"

RPM will not know whether to update pam first or glibc if the new pam requires the new glibc. For example, pam requires libc.so.6(GLIBC_2.34)(64bit), so if you are upgrading from pre-2.34 glibc, it's not installable until glibc is upgraded.\n\nThis has to be handled in a different way.\n\n> > I definitely want to change the glibc default.\n> \n> Yes, fully agreed -- being able to resolve \"localhost\" without\n> /etc/nsswitch.conf and /etc/hosts would certainly be nice.

I haven't had one for a while, and it'd be nice for distros to stop creating it. But that's of course a tangent.\n\n> I don't think it's *that* simple because of the potential for a dependency\n> loop, sorry.\n\nOK, then I supose the only way is to declare the broken dependencies as \"wontfix\", and not supporting partial upgrades (FWIW, it's not like I was actively trying to do a partial upgrade, dnf just happened to do that when installing packages -- but again, hopefully fixed now with a fresh set of cloud images).\n\nThanks!"

This results is a significant performance gain on aarch64, where this function is otherwise implemented using a system call.\n\nThis update removes support for the `LD_PREFER_MAP_32BIT_EXEC` environment variable because it was no longer working with the executables produced by current binutils versions.",
