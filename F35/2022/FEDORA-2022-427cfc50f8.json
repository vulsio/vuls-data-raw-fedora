It would contain the body of options { } tag, making it easier to adding  options from scripts. Very useful for cases when you want just adding forwarders and there is no good way for automated configuration change.\n\n- Changing default working directory from /var to /var/lib/named and /var/cache/named for having a secondary zones. It would make bind follow better FHS used by common applications. Chroot would still work, at the cost of extra two bind-mounts.\n\nOtherwise there is no other blocker."
