So I suggested him to enable the pcsc-lite service\nhttps://github.com/open-eid/linux-installer/issues/13#issuecomment-363720550\n\nBy reading your statement I am assuming qdigidoc is missing something that should trigger pcsc-lite to be enabled on demand. If yes, could you please give me some hints?\n\nThank you very much\n\n[1]: http://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/qdigidoc"

This is consistent with Fedora Packaging Guidelines. The is no specific rule that starting after installation is not allowed (although I think there was one in the past and got dropped by mistake, it'd probably be worth to investigate this and open an FPC ticket…), but the Guidelines specify that rpms should have certain scriptlets, which in turn indirectly means the same thing.\n\nMy recommendation would be to add an udev rule that would trigger pcscd.service when the right hardware is plugged in.

The reason this is not done is that generally we don't want package installation to immediately start running services, in case the installation in a mock environment, or some other chroot, etc. I think we might want to change this policy, but this would be subject for a bigger discussion. This policy made sense in sysvinit days, because it was hard to reliably detect if running in a chroot. But nowadays it's fairly easy to check if systemd is running, and if it is, then the service most likely could be started. This has been on my mind for a while, but I haven't yet considered all the edge cases. It's probably something for discussion on fedora-devel.\n\n> Also I don't think we would need to enumerate all the devices, since the standard CCID should have specific interface class.\n\nA rule based on the interface class would be great.\n\nIt'd be best to have a smartcard.target, and the udev rule would have ENV{SYSTEMD_WANTS}+=\"smartcard.target\", and pcscd.socket or pcscd.socket would get an additional WantedBy=smartcard.target in the [Install] section."

In the Fedora text on default services [0], it says \"Only services that meet the criteria below are permitted to be enabled by default on package installation\". That is, the 'package installation' time is quite explicit; there is no reboot requirement, and IMHO\nno ambiguity here. After reading that I would have expected services to be operational, on package installation. Should I still start a discussion to Fedora devel or is that sufficient to move that issue to systemd?\n\n[0].\nhttps://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:DefaultServices"

						"thetext": "There's a clear distinction between 'enable' and 'start' in this context.\n\n\"enable\" has a very specific meaning, that of systemctl enable, i.e. creation of symlinks so that the service will be started on reboot (or more precisely whenever multi-user.target is started). It does not mean that the service will be operational immediately.\n\nAs for \"start\", the guidelines do not explicitly say anything about either way. But consider the following:\n- the scriptlets that are \"blessed\" by FPC do *not* start the services [https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:Scriptlets?#Systemd]\n\n- there's an old FAQ entry [https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL:SysVInitScripts?rd=Packaging:SysVInitScript#Why_don.27t_we] that says: > Why don't we....\n>    start the service after installation?\n>    Installations can be in changeroots, in an installer context, or in other situations where you don't want the services started.\n\nMy hypothesis is that the rule to not start services during installation was documented explicitly in the guidelines when sysvinit was used, and then got lost during the transition to systemctl. But current practice is certainly to *not* start the services during installation, as following by a great majority of packages.\n\nTo change this, I think the following is necessary:\n- make sure that 'systemctl start' properly ignores the request in all contexts where it must be ignored (dnf install --installroot, anaconda, mock, rpm-ostree, etc.).\n- modify systemd preset command to support --now, to mean \"if enabled in presets, enable and start\".\n- update %systemd_post to use 'preset --now'.\n- update the guidelines to describe the new situation (essentially to say that the service will be started if dnf install is used on a running system and presets specify that the package should be enabled)."

I was not able to follow them in recent month.\n\nThis discussion somehow subsided, but the feedback was generally positive, so I believe we should go on with this change for Fedora 29. It will clearly need most of the work on the documentation, addjusting packaging guidelines and systemd side and the minimum on the packages using this functionality.\n\nWould you (Zbigniew, somebody else from systemd?) like to fill a F29 change proposal? If not, I can do it, but I will certainly need some help or at least somebody on systemd side, who could give me a hand there."

If you would still like \nto see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version \nof Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora \nversion prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.\n\nAlthough we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's \nlifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events.
