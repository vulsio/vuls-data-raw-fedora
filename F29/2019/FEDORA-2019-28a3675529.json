It's receiving a 503 service unavailable error, and endlessly retries the operation, multiple times per second.\n\nI couldn't find fixes related to this in the release notes at https://gnupg.org/download/release_notes.html, nor did I find any similar bug reports on the Redhat Bugzilla.\n\nVersion-Release number of selected component (if applicable):\n\ngnupg2-2.2.13-1.fc29.x86_64\n\nHow reproducible:\n\nI'm not sure what triggers the execution of dirmngr.  The system was unattended when it happened this morning.  However, when it's running, it's generally affected by this.\n\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. wait until dirmngr starts running\n2.\n3.\n\nActual results:\nNetwork traffic of about 10KB/second down, 5KB/second up, attempting to connect to https://keys.fedoraproject.org:443/ but receiving error 503 service unavailable each time.\n\nExpected results:\nI'm unfamiliar with the function of dirmngr, but presumably this will keep it from doing its regular job.\n\n\nAdditional info:\n\nI'm attaching the first 500 lines from dirmngr.log, with debug level set to advanced."

It's using the default value.\n\nkeys.fedoraproject.org is resolving to CNAME keys01.fedoraproject.org., A 140.211.169.207, which is the host returning error 503.  The whois command reports this IP range belongs to Network for Education and Research in Oregon (NERO), Eugene, OR.  Contact information is provided there also.\n\nAside from that element of the fedoraproject.org infrastructure providing an error code, the second problem is that dirmngr immediately retrying the operation that's doomed to fail, rather than delaying or trying another keys host.  The CNAME of keys01.fedoraproject.org makes me think there was an intention to also have keys02, keys03, etc. and rotate among them as is done with pool.ntp.org, but that was not done.  keys02.fedoraproject.org resolves to another IP within the same range as keys01.  There is no keys03.fedoraproject.org.  It seems strange that there's a dependency on a single IP range within the state of Oregon, given the international user base of Fedora.\n\nMy logfile indicates that it's receiving commands from an instance of /usr/bin/gpg2 that seems to have been started by thunderbird, in the middle of the night.\n\nIt is possible to run it manually from the command line.  Just type \"dirmngr\", and after producing some output ending in \"OK Dirmngr 2.2.13 at your service\", it will await commands.  The two commands you need to reproduce the behavior are\n\nKEYSERVER --clear hkps://keys.fedoraproject.org:443\n\nand\n\nKS_GET -- 0x8657980D9AB51E50\n\nafter which you should see the effects of its retry loop."

Poisoned certificates are already on the SKS keyserver network.\n\n- This attack cannot be mitigated by the SKS keyserver network in any reasonable time frame.\n- Currently there is no mitigation or patch available for GnuPG\n\nThe OpenPGP specification puts no limitation on how many signatures can be attached to a certificate. The keyserver network handles certificates with up to about 150,000 signatures.\n\nGnuPG, on the other hand does not. Any time GnuPG has to deal with such a spammed certificate, GnuPG grinds to a halt. It doesn't stops and is rendered completely unusable."

If someone were to poison a vendor's public certificate and upload it to the keyserver network, the next time a system administrator refreshed their keyring from the keyserver network the vendor's now-poisoned certificate would be downloaded. At that point upgrades become impossible because the authenticity of downloaded packages cannot be verified. Even downloading the vendor's certificate and re-importing it would be of no use, because GnuPG would choke trying to import the new certificate. It is not hard to imagine how motivated adversaries could employ this against a Linux-based computer network.\n\nRed Hat Signing certificates are available at: https://access.redhat.com/security/team/key\n\nA copy of the signing keys are stored on Red Hat website in case the key server is not used.

Ensure there is no line starting with keyserver. If there is, remove it.\n2. Open ~/.gnupg/dirmngr.conf in a text editor. Add the line \"keyserver hkps://keys.openpgp.org\" to the end of it.\n\nkeys.openpgp.org is a new experimental keyserver which is not part of the keyserver network and has some features which make it resistant to this attack. It is not a drop-in replacement: it has some limitations (for instance, its search functionality is sharply constrained). However, once you make this change you will be able to run gpg --refresh-keys with confidence.\n\nFor installations which are currently rendered unusable by this attack, the following repair method is advised:\n1. If you know which certificate is likely poisoned, try deleting it. Once the installation becomes usable again, you can acquire a new unpoisoned copy of the certificate and re-import it.\n2. If you do not know which certificate is poisoned, best option is to get a list of all your certificate IDs, delete your keyrings completely, and rebuild from scratch using known-good copies of the public certificates."
