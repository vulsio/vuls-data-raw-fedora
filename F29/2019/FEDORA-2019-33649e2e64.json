	"notes": "Upstream announcement:\n\nWelcome to **phpMyAdmin 4.9.0.1**, a bugfix release that includes important security fixes.\n\nThis release fixes two security vulnerabilities:\n\n* PMASA-2019-3 is an SQL injection flaw in the Designer feature\n* PMASA-2019-4 is a CSRF attack that's possible through the 'cookie' login form\n\nUpgrading is highly recommended for all users. Using the 'http' auth_type instead of 'cookie' can mitigate the CSRF attack.\n\nThe solution for the CSRF attack does remove the former functionality to log in directly through URL parameters (as mentioned in FAQ 4.8, such as https://example.com/phpmyadmin/?pma_username=root&password=foo). Such behavior was discouraged and is now removed. Other query parameters work as expected; only pma_username and pma_password have been removed.\n\nThis release also includes fixes for many bugs, including:\n\n- Several issues with SYSTEM VERSIONING tables\n- Fixed json encode error in export\n- Fixed JavaScript events not activating on input (sql bookmark issue)\n- Show Designer combo boxes when adding a constraint\n- Fix edit view\n- Fixed invalid default value for bit field\n- Fix several errors relating to GIS data types\n- Fixed javascript error PMA_messages is not defined\n- Fixed import XML data with leading zeros\n- Fixed php notice, added support for 'DELETE HISTORY' table privilege (MariaDB >= 10.3.4)\n- Fixed MySQL 8.0.0 issues with GIS display\n- Fixed \"Server charset\" in \"Database server\" tab showing wrong information\n- Fixed can not copy user on Percona Server 5.7\n- Updated sql-parser to version 4.3.2, which fixes several parsing and linting problems\n\nThere are many, many more bug fixes thanks to the efforts of our developers, Google Summer of Code applicants, and other contributors.\n\nThe phpMyAdmin team\n\n----\n\n**phpmyadmin/sql-parser version 4.3.2**\n\n* Fix redundant whitespaces in build() outputs (#228)\n* Fix incorrect error on DEFAULT keyword in ALTER operation (#229)\n* Fix incorrect outputs from Query::getClause (#233)\n* Add support for reading an SQL file from stdin\n* Fix for missing tokenize-query in Composer's vendor/bin/ directory\n* Fix for PHP warnings with an incomplete CASE expression (#241)\n* Fix for error message with multiple CALL statements (#223)\n* Recognize the question mark character as a parameter (#242)\n\n",
