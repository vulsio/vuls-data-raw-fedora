						"thetext": "Description of problem: The Drupal8 package doesn't include a dependency for php-zendframework-zend-loader, which seems to be required\n\n\nVersion-Release number of selected component (if applicable): 8.6.2\n\n\nHow reproducible: Install the package and try to access http://localhost/drupal8/ \n\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. sudo dnf install drupal8 mariadb-server php-mysqlnd\n2. sudo systemctl enable httpd mysqld\n3. sudo ls /usr/share/drupal8/sites/default/default.settings.php /usr/share/drupal8/sites/default/settings.php\n4. chmod 666 /usr/share/drupal8/sites/default/settings.php\n5. sudo systemctl start httpd mysqld\n7. Access http://localhost/drupal8\n\nActual results: Nothing displays in browser. /etc/httpd/logs/access_log shows 500 error. /var/log/php-fpm/www-error.log shows the following\n\nPHP Fatal error:  require_once(): Failed opening required '/usr/share/php/Zend/autoload.php' (include_path='.:/usr/share/pear:/usr/share/php') in /usr/share/drupal8/autoload.php on line 46\n\n\nExpected results: http://localhost/drupal8/core/install.php should ask the user to choose a language for initial set up of drupal.\n\n\nAdditional info: Installing the package manually fixes the issue, but I would think the package should be required if Drupal doesn't work without it. There may be other ways to configure Drupal that don't require the package, but if so, those methods should be documented. The Drupal instructions from Fedora currently are from 2015, for Drupal 7. Admittedly, I only have a little experience with Drupal 8, so this might be a misunderstanding on my part."
