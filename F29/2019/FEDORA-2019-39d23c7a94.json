Open dolphin\n2. Navigate into a large directory structure with several hundred or thousand subdirectories, this is mounted via NFS in my case\n3. Scroll around a bit or enter a subdirectory\n\nActual results:\ndolphin deadlocks, new KDE apps lock at start too. Killing gam_server resolves the problem instantly\n\nExpected results:\nall programs continue to work\n\nThe symptoms are very much like bug #786170, but that one is fixed. So this is probably a new bug."

Killing gam_server resolves the problem instantly\n\nThe \"trick\" is the large directory structure. And I think having it mounted via nfs adds additional latency and makes it more likely that you trigger it. But when I wrote the original bug report, it also happened with large dir structures on a local disk. But now I nearly exclusively use SSDs and it is harder to trigger it with them.\n\nI haven't investigated further if it only affects programs based on KDE 4 or also programs based on KDE 5."

It sometimes happens when I'm using the desktop, and it certainly happens when I'm not. Having disk ripped away from running processes probably doesn't do any good.\n\nBooting this desktop and running it after it feels good - no swap and everything responds fine. Leaving it on and coming back later, next day or so - there is a lot of swap and some functions don't work anymore."

	"notes": "This update fixes **CVE-2019-14744 (kconfig arbitrary shell code execution)** in the compatibility library `kdelibs` 4 used by legacy applications (not yet ported to KDE Frameworks 5). The included `kde-settings` update removes obsolete settings that conflict with the security fix and are no longer needed (see below for details).\n\nThe full list of fixes in the `kdelibs` 4 build:\n\n* fixes **CVE-2019-14744 (#1740138, #1740140)** – `kconfig`: malicious `.desktop` files (and others) would execute code. KConfig had a well-meaning feature that allowed configuration files to execute arbitrary shell commands. Unfortunately, this could be abused by untrusted `.desktop` files to execute arbitrary code as the target user, without the user even running the `.desktop` file. Therefore, this update removes that ill-fated feature. (Patch from upstream: `kf5-kconfig` fix by David Faure, `kdelibs` 4 backport by Kai Uwe Broulik.)\n* fixes **#917848** – removes support for the `gamin` file watching service which is unmaintained and buggy and can lead to application lockups. KDirWatch now relies exclusively on `inotify` (directly). (Packaging fix by Rex Dieter.)\n* fixes **#1730770** – removes an unused dependency on the obsolete `xf86misc` library. (Packaging fix by Kevin Kofler.)\n\nThe fixes in the `kde-settings` build remove settings that were calling `xdg-user-dir`, because the above CVE-2019-14744 fix drops support for running shell commands from configuration files from KConfig and because the settings are all no longer needed (because they either only reproduce default behavior or were commented out):\n\n* `/usr/share/kde-settings/kde-profile/default/share/config/kdeglobals`, `/usr/share/kde-settings/kde-profile/minimal/share/config/kdeglobals`: Remove the `[Paths]` section. The `Desktop` and `Documents` directories that were set there are already detected by default by `kdelibs` 4 (it has native support for xdg-user-dirs and does not need the external `xdg-user-dir` command invocation), and now also by `kdelibs3 >= 3.5.10-101` (which has native xdg-user-dirs support backported). The `Trash` setting was already commented out.\n* `/usr/share/kde-settings/kde-profile/default/xdg/baloofilerc`: Delete the commented-out `folders` setting that attempts to call `xdg-user-dir`.",
