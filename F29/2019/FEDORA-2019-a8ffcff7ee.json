However the CVE-2018-0495 issue does not apply to Bouncycastle, thus it is considered \"not affected\" by this flaw.\n\nBouncycastle inherently relies upon Java BigInteger arithmetic, which is not constant-time by design, so other countermeasures are needed to mitigate timing/side channel attacks.  In RSA operations, Bouncycastle uses blinding (ref CVE-2016-1000341).  Since 1.59, EC operations use a table lookup to prevent information leaks through similar channels."

								"thetext": "The One&Done attack, which is described in a paper to appear in the USENIX Security'18 conference, uses EM emanations to recover the values of the bits that are obtained using BN_is_bit_set while constructing the value of the window in BN_mod_exp_consttime. The EM signal changes slightly depending on the value of the bit, and since the lookup of a bit is surrounded by highly regular execution (constant-time Montgomery multiplications) the attack is able to isolate the (very brief) part of the signal that changes depending on the bit. Although the change is slight, the attack recovers it successfully >90% of the time on several phones and IoT devices (all with ARM processors with clock rates around 1GHz), so after only one RSA decryption more than 90% of the bits in d_p and d_q are recovered correctly, which enables rapid recovery of the full RSA key using an algorithm (also described in the paper) that modifies the branch-and-prune approach for a situation in which the exponents' bits are recovered with errors, i.e. where we do not know a priori which bits are correctly recovered.\n\n\nUpstream Pull Request:\n\nhttps://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/6276\n\n\nReference:\n\nhttps://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity18/sec18-alam.pdf"
