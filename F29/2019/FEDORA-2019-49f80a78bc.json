The impact of this bug is such that directories with permissions (relative to the user) of exactly -wx (writable, searchable but not readable) will be erroneously skipped.  Finally, a randomly-generated filename is used, appropriate permissions (0600) and open(2) flags are used, and the file is unlinked once sqlite is finished with it.\n\nRHEL ships by default with mode 1777 on /var/tmp, /usr/tmp and /tmp.\n\nFor this flaw to have any impact on a RHEL system:\n\n  - the sysadmin would need to have changed permissions on all three tmp directories\n  - the affected application would need to chdir() to a dangerous location:  in particular, a network share with poor permissions management, or removable media\n  - the application would need to use VACUUM, a temp database, a materialized view, statement journals or transient indices involving sensitive data\n  - an attacker would need to race to access the file, or recover it from deleted blocks\n\nRHEL's builds of sqlite do not override any default options nor patch the source in a way that impacts this issue."

If you would still like \nto see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version \nof Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora \nversion prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.\n\nAlthough we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's \nlifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a \nmore recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes \nbugs or makes them obsolete."
