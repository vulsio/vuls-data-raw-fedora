(Note that this patch cannot be applied already indicates that there are some large changes between 6.9.1 and 6.9.2 at least on code level, which is the reason I did not upgrade oniguruma to 6.9.1 on Fedora 29).\nFor a quick glance, oniguruma 6.9.2 appears to be affected by this, however I think it needs some longer investigation how to apply the fix to oniguruma 6.9.2.\n\nRHEL8 seems to be using 6.8.2, EPEL7 seems to be using 5.9.5, which need much longer investigation, I think."

The wrong byte code further leads to a Segmentation Fault in match_at() function, as it handles regular characters as memory addresses instead. An attacker can leverage this by producing a regular expression crafted to trigger the bug leading to DoS.\n\nThe attack complexity may be considered High as the target software may need to accept and compile untrusted regular expressions and the attacker my need to check which oniguruma version is being used on the victim side, as only Oniguruma v6.5.0 an above implements the if/else pattern."
