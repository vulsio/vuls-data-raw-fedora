						"thetext": "There is a pretty strict guideline for following the upstream versioning, according to the package guidelines. https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:Versioning#Simple_versioning reads, \"To package release versions of software using this versioning scheme: Use the upstream verbatim in the Version: tag. Don't trim leading zeroes...\"\n\nIn the absence of following that guideline, there is no comment or information in the spec file that allows me to deduce the pedigree or origins of the file that is being used, which makes it very difficult for me to figure out exactly what sources are being packaged.\n\nOn the question of if a full URL should be used, https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:Guidelines#Tags_and_Sections states that, \"The Source: tags document where to find the upstream sources for the package. In most cases this SHOULD be a complete URL to the upstream tarball.\"\n\nFurther information is then linked at https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:SourceURL. This page begins by saying, \"One of the design goals of rpm is to cleanly separate upstream source from vendor modifications. For the Fedora packager, this means that sources used to build a package should be the vanilla sources available from upstream.\" It continues by saying, \"The most common case is where upstream distributes source as a tar.gz, tar.bz2 or zip archive that we can download from an upstream website. In these cases you must use a full URL to the package in the SourceX: line.\"\n\nIf you're not following this, I presume there was an exception made at some point. However, by not at least mentioning this anywhere in the spec file, you make it impossible to even follow the track and pedigree of your code back through time without an overwhelming amount of work. I was finally able to verify your tarball was the same as upstream by unpacking it, then running diff across the sources. That amount of effort should not be required for a person to follow the source's trail.\n\nI mainly bring this all up because I maintain the mingw-nspr package. Our automated scripts keep flagging nspr/mingw-nspr as being different between the native and cross-compiled versions. I wanted to be sure that I was packaging the same thing, because the versions *seemed* to be the same, just differing in the absent trailing \".0\".\n\nSo the package guidelines do dictate that you need to use the same versioning scheme as upstream and include the full source URL to your files. I presume, like most things, exceptions can be granted but it would seem reasonable to include a mention of such an exclusion in the spec file if one were available."

Note that, however, to proceed with the change we need to wait for a new release, because 4.19 < 4.19.0."

So to recap, the problem was:\n- Some dependent packages assume that the package version and the pkg-config version are equivalent and are using that fact to determine the build-time depenedency\n- However, before that bug was filed, the package version didn't match with the pkg-config version, when the trailing \".0\" was omitted\n\nIn that case, adding \".0\" to always use three-component version numbers seems reasonable to me, given that nspr/nss internally use three-component version numbers (e.g., NSS_VMAJOR/NSS_VMINOR/NSS_VPATCH macros).  It also conforms to the semantic versioning recommendations (https://semver.org/)."
