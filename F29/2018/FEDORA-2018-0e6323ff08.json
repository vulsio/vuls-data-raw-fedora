Unless gluster gets instructed to place the metrics somewhere the application chooses (volume option?).\n\n> For 4.1.x series, I guess it should be just documentation bug, and we should\n> be creating the directory in master for now, if everyone feels that is the\n> right thing.\n\nThis feels like a rather crucial failure, the missing directory prevents metrics from being stored. It would be just as easy and quick to fix the problem in 4.1.x as documenting a fix? I'd be in favour for a backport :)"
