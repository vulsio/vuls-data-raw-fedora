If I use the package-provided libfreetype.so, the color fringing is stronger than if I use a compiled-from-source vanilla libfreetype.so without any changes to compile options or system settings.

Leaving FreeType vanilla (thereby using the alternative subpixel rendering method that, according to the comment above the FT_CONFIG_OPTION_SUBPIXEL_RENDERING define, does not need filtering) gives you proper looking subpixel rendering.\n\nSo I guess there's two possibilities:\n1) Try to recompile cairo/Qt for these changes.\n2) Delete freetype-2.3.0-enable-spr.patch and freetype-2.9-ftsmooth.patch and use the alternative implementation that works surprisingly well, at least on my landscape-rotated, RGB-subpixel monitor.\n\nThe alternative implementation does not support setting LCD filters manually (as it is essentially the light LCD filter), so one would not be able to use fontconfig's lcdfilter settings. I think. Not sure if this affects anything else."

Possibilities are:\n\n1) Ask cairo maintainers to change the default lcd filter (to which one? I would prefer FT_LCD_FILTER_LIGHT but there is FT_LCD_FILTER_DEFAULT in freetype so it should be it probably)\n2) Add a configurable option to Gnome and let users configure it as subpixel rendering itself\n3) Select a filter in freetype code by default (Which one? And others might prefer to configure it still.)\n4) Use Harmony (it does not use LCD filters)\n\nI would go with number 1 for now.\n\nBtw, you can change the lcd filter by setting e.g. \"Xft.lcdfilter: lcdlight\" in \"~/.Xresources\" for now (see https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/font_configuration for additional info)."

They are both within the paper conclusions. DEFAULT is wider and blurrier and therefore more resistant to incorrect gamma correction. LIGHT is as good as it gets provided that gamma correction is also used.\n\nHarmony is bit-identical to LIGHT withing small rounding error. In the next release it will be possible to tune Harmony for some PenTile displays, which is impossible with simple filters. That might be a reason to prefer Harmony.\n\nWe at FreeType might soon consider enabling filtering by default so that users are not forced to make a choice, rather NONE will need to be selected.\n\nFinally it is possible to undefine USE_LEGACY in ftlcdfil.c, so that it is never used."

Given Nikolaus's comment 14, I'm guessing that this needs a separate fix.\n\nI'm using a standard Fedora 29 Cinnamon spin, fully updated (as of now, 2018-12-07). Nikolaus's fix from comment 20 of 'ln -s /usr/share/fontconfig/conf.avail/11-lcdfilter-light.conf /etc/fonts/conf.d/' fixes the problem both before and after the update to cairo-1.16.0-2, even on firefox.\n\nNote that the Cinnamon spin (and possibly others) have a default of slight hinting and subpixel (shown as 'rgba') antialiasing, so Cinnamon users are seeing very bad colour fringing since the problem arose. So perhaps the priority on this bug should be raised."
