												"thetext": "From the Anaconda DNF Test Day. Test: take a kickstart whose %packages is just:\n\n%packages\n@core\n%end\n\ninstall it with DNF, then install it with yum ('inst.nodnf'). The yum install actually crashes at the end due to https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1173419 , but you can chroot into the installed system (/mnt/sysimage) to count packages and do whatever else you need to do.\n\nWhen installed with DNF, you get 376 packages. With yum, you get 304. Note, this isn't reproducible with the 'minimal' environment group, because that adds the fedora-release-nonproduct package; when that's included, DNF manages to do the right thing. It's only reproducible with a kickstart that uses @core and doesn't pull in fedora-release-nonproduct.\n\nThe difference turns out to be fedora-release-server and all its dependencies. fedora-release-server is pulled in by firewalld-config-server. What's going on is that firewalld is in @core, and it requires config(firewalld), which is a virtual provide that all the different firewalld-config-(flavor) packages and firewalld-config-standard provide.\n\nyum, using one of its heuristics or other, decides to use firewalld-config-standard to solve the requirement, which is the best choice - it leads to the smallest package set.\n\ndnf, which doesn't have yum's heuristics (hence this bug is in part a case of https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1181567 ), picks firewalld-config-server , pulling in fedora-release-server, rolekit, yum (ironically enough), a bunch of perl packages, and whatever else.\n\nAs mentioned this is partly a case of #1181567 - DNF's different handling of ambiguous deps compared to yum - but it could also be considered an issue in the whole mechanism of per-flavor config and release packages, so filing against distribution. sgallagh has suggested just taking firewalld out of @core as a simple workaround.\n\nWe'd then have the question of whether it should go in @standard, but I suspect a lot more people have kickstarts with @core in than have kickstarts with @standard in."

We found that the problem was specifically because the docker base image kickstart includes the directive\n\nfirewall --disable.\n\nIn anaconda, this actually causes the firewall-config package to be pulled in, which pulls in firewalld and so on. Omitting this line for the docker base image is both safe and will avoid pulling things in.\n\nAs for the issue with firewalld in @core, that should be less of a problem once the patches I have on review for BZ #1146487 are pushed. We will no longer be relying on package deps to pull in fedora-release-$edition packages; firewalld and other packages that need per-product differences will simply be able to rely on the contents of /etc/os-release. So if no edition package has been specified, it will just use the default configuration. This will make life much easier."

Please don't drop packages in stable releases unless completely necessary, especially when there are packages depending on them:\n$ rpm -q --whatrequires python-rhsm\nvirt-who-0.17-4.fc27.noarch\n$ rpm -q --whatprovides python-rhsm\nsubscription-manager-rhsm-1.21.1-1.fc27.x86_64\n\nAnd when you do remove packages, add proper Obsoletes/Provides as appropriate (https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:Guidelines?rd=Packaging/Guidelines#Renaming.2FReplacing_Existing_Packages). I presume the python3-subscription-manager-rhsm subpackage is supposed to replace subscription-manager-rhsm, but it doesn't have proper Obsoletes:\nhttps://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/rpminfo?rpmID=13216072\n\nPlease readd the package or coordinate with maintainers of dependent packages to change their dependencies.\n\nVersion-Release number of selected component (if applicable):\nsubscription-manager-1.21.2-3.fc27.x86_64"

Please see the attached bugs for more specific details on what has improved as far as stability is concerned.\n\nThere is also a larger new feature which is being released in concert with work being done in Katello / Foreman. Subscription-manager has a concept of a package-profile. This contains information on all installed rpm packages for the system on which it is running.\n\nWe have expanded this reporting capability to include information on enabled and installed modules from modulemd as well as to report on which repositories this system has enabled presently.\n\nThis information is combined into a group of reports and submitted to the same endpoint on Katello / Foreman. \n\nThe new request is a PUT to /consumers/{consumer_uuid}/profiles.\nThis is done only when the string \"combined_reporting\" in the managerCapabilities key of the response to a GET /status.\n\nThe old just rpm profile reporting is still done as a PUT to /consumers/{consumer_uuid}/packages. This is at this point only done if the server side does not support the new capability.\n\nMore will likely be added in the future to further expand on this capability of reporting.\n",
