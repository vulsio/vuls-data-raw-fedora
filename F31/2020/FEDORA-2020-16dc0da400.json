Red Hat Satellite may update `python-twisted` and `python-twisted-web` in future.\n\nThis issue affects the version of python-twisted(embedded in calamari-server) shipped with Red Hat Ceph Storage 2. However, calamari is no longer supported, hence the embedded python-twisted package will not be fixed."

For this reason, the RHOSP impact has been lowered to moderate and no update will be provided at this time for the RHOSP python-twisted package .\n\nOpenShift Container Platform 4.3 and later includes `python-twisted` as a dependency of `python-prometheus_client` in Ironic container images, however the affected code is not used.\n\nRed Hat Satellite uses affected versions of `python-twisted` and  `python-twisted-web` modules in Pulp, however, it is not vulnerable since `http` modal of web implementation is not expose in product. Red Hat Satellite may update `python-twisted` and `python-twisted-web` in future.\n\nThis issue affects the version of python-twisted(embedded in calamari-server) shipped with Red Hat Ceph Storage 2. However, calamari is no longer supported, hence the embedded python-twisted package will not be fixed."
