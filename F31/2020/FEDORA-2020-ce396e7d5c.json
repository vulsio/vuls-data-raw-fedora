An attacker can exploit the flaw if all of the following are true:\n* An attacker is able to control the contents and name of a file on the server.\n* The server is configured to use the PersistenceManager with a FileStore.\n* The PersistenceManager is configured with sessionAttributeValueClassNameFilter=\"null\" (the default unless a SecurityManager is used) or a sufficiently lax filter to allow the attacker-provided object to be deserialized.\n* The attacker knows the relative file path from the storage location used by FileStore to the file the attacker has control over.\nIf all these conditions are true, the attacker can use a specifically crafted request to trigger Remote Code Execution through deserialization of the file under their control.\n\nThis flaw affects the following Tomcat versions: 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.0-M4, 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.34, 8.5.0 to 8.5.54, and 7.0.0 to 7.0.103.\n\nUpstream commits:\n\nTomcat 10.0: https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/bb33048e3f9b4f2b70e4da2e6c4e34ca89023b1b\nTomcat 9.0: https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/3aa8f28db7efb311cdd1b6fe15a9cd3b167a2222\nTomcat 8.5: https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/ec08af18d0f9ddca3f2d800ef66fe7fd20afef2f\nTomcat 7.0: https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/53e30390943c18fca0c9e57dbcc14f1c623cfd06"

The use of pki-servlet-engine outside of these contexts is not supported. As a result, the vulnerability can not be triggered in supported configurations of these products. A future update may update Tomcat in pki-servlet-engine.\n\nRed Hat Satellite do not ship Tomcat and rather use its configuration. The product is not affected because configuration does not make use of PersistanceManager or FileStore. Tomcat updates can be obtain from Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) RHSA."
