								"thetext": "(This was just reported by a RHEL (CentOS?) user in IRC, which led me to realize that while the RHEL-AV libvirt package had this bug fixed by virtue of a rebase to libvirt-6.6.0 in RHEL-AV-8.3.0, the standard RHEL8 libvirt package actually had this bug *introduced* in RHEL-8.3.0 by rebasing from libvirt-4.5.0 (when we didn't yet have private iptables chains) to libvirt-6.0.0.\n\nSince libvirt in standard RHEL8 will remain based on 6.0.0 for quite some time still, we need to backport the patches described here. I think there are also one or two other similar fixes related to switching to private chains that need to be found and backported at the same time.\n\n+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #1813830 +++\n\nDescription of problem: In a stock Fedora 31 or 32 one often cannot restart libvirt's \"default\" network (virbr0).

This is good enough for our integration tests.\n\n\n--- Additional comment from Laine Stump on 2020-05-08 01:53:44 UTC ---\n\nThis is due to an optimization in libvirt's network driver. Because 1) attempting to create a private iptables chain when it already exists results in an error, and 2) repeatedly looking to see if a chain exists for every network that is started is very inefficient and makes for a slow startup time, the network driver only calls the function that creates the private chains once per libvirtd run. This was done based on the assumption that firewalld would keep all of the iptables chains created by libvirt intact, which is in fact not the case.\n\nInstead we need to recreate the private chains any time we are notified (via dbus) that firewalld has restarted.\n\n--- Additional comment from Laine Stump on 2020-05-08 02:53:52 UTC ---\n\nI just posted these two patches upstream:\n\nhttps://www.redhat.com/archives/libvir-list/2020-May/msg00344.html\n\n--- Additional comment from Laine Stump on 2020-05-19 17:41:06 UTC ---\n\nThe following two patches will be in upstream libvirt-6.4.0. We should backport them to both the F31 and F32 builds of libvirt.\n\ncommit de110f110fb917a31b9f33ad8e4b3c1d3284766a\nAuthor: Laine Stump <laine@redhat.com>\nDate:   Thu May 7 22:32:59 2020 -0400\n\n    network: make it safe to call networkSetupPrivateChains() multiple times\n\ncommit f5418b427e7d2f26803880309478de9103680826\nAuthor: Laine Stump <laine@redhat.com>\nDate:   Thu May 7 21:54:39 2020 -0400\n\n    network: force re-creation of iptables private chains on firewalld restart"

								"thetext": "The thing that you're remembering is that it's not supported to either stop firewalld (and have it remain stopped) or start firewalld (and have it remain started) while a single libvirtd is running - if you do this you need to restart libvirtd.\n\nThe test that you're running *should* be working properly though, because you only stop firewalld and then immediately start it (which is effectively the same as a restart, which is fine). My guess is that possibly you are running iptables -L and attempting to start the default network the final time so soon after firewalld has been restarted that there hasn't yet been time for libvirtd to receive and process the dbus message telling it that firewalld has been restarted. Try putting a sleep 5 or something into the script just before the final \"iptables -L\".\n\nAssuming my theory is correct, I don't think there is any way for libvirt to guarantee a successful start of a network in this case - it doesn't know that firewalld has restarted until it gets the dbus message, but that message won't arrive until some time after all of libvirt's chains/rules have already been removed by the firewalld restart; if libvirt tries to start a new network during that time, it won't know that it's chains are temporarily missing, and so will be correct in complaining about it. As long as the rules are \"eventually\" added back, and a delayed attempt to start a new network is successful without any other intervention, then I think we've done the best that we can do."

Because 1) attempting to create a private iptables chain when it already exists results in an error, and 2) repeatedly looking to see if a chain exists for every network that is started is very inefficient and makes for a slow startup time, the network driver only calls the function that creates the private chains once per libvirtd run. This was done based on the assumption that firewalld would keep all of the iptables chains created by libvirt intact, which is in fact not the case.\n\nInstead we need to recreate the private chains any time we are notified (via dbus) that firewalld has restarted."
