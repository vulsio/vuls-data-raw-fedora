In the above example dhcpv6 client succedes, but\nthe dhcpv4 client get 'no address available'. Swapping the order of the\ntwo entries in the config file allow the dhcpv4 client to succeed, but\nthen the dhcpv5 client fails.\n\nAlternative configurations that do work in 2.81:\n\n dhcp-host=52:54:00:bc:c3:fd,172.20.0.11,host2\n dhcp-host=tag:dhcpv6,52:54:00:bc:c3:fd,[fd12:3456:789a:1::aadd],host2\n\nor: \n\n dhcp-host=52:54:00:bc:c3:fd,172.20.0.11,[fd12:3456:789a:1::aadd],host2\n\n\nI'm not sure using two dhcp-host entries was ever intended to work, as\nthe manual page states that both ipv4 and ipv6 address can be defined\nin a single entry.\n\nA first tought for possible fix would be to internally set the\n'tag:dhcpv6' for any dhcp-host entry with only ipv6 addresse(s).\n\nIt impacts e.g. OpenStack Neutron, see https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1829201 for details.\n\n--- Additional comment from Petr Menšík on 2020-05-11 12:25:00 CEST ---\n\nPatch posted to upstream list by Harald[1].\n\n1. http://lists.thekelleys.org.uk/pipermail/dnsmasq-discuss/2020q2/014051.html"
