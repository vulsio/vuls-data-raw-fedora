However, the check is flawed and doesn't properly check for when the options are used in the reversed order: first using -J and then -i were mistakenly accepted.\n~~~\n\nTo me, that suggests the sky isn't falling because you have to use \"-J -i\" (in that order) along with -O.  If you're not using \"-J\" or not using \"-i\" or using \"-i\" before \"-J\" then you're not vulnerable."

If this gets fixed in curl-7.29.0-58 then we can have them update their plugin and all is well."

However, the check is flawed and doesn't properly check for when the options are used in the reversed order: first using -J and then -i were mistakenly accepted.\n~~~\n\nTo me, that suggests the sky isn't falling because you have to use \"-J -i\" (in that order) along with -O.
