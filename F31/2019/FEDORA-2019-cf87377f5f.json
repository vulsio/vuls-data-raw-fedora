Hikari is not packaged as an RPM for Red Hat Enterprise Linux or Red Hat Software Collections. Applications using jackson-databind that do not also use com.zaxxer.hikari are not impacted by this vulnerability.\n\nA mitigation to this class of problem in jackson-databind is to not trigger polymorphic desrialization globally by using: objectMapper.enableDefaultTyping() and rather use @JsonTypeInfo on the class property to explicitly define the type information. For more information on this issue please refer to https://www.github.com/mbechler/marshalsec/blob/master/marshalsec.pdf?raw=true"

We may update the jackson-databind dependency in a future release.\n\nWhile OpenShift Container Platform's elasticsearch plugins do ship the vulnerable component, it doesn't do any of the unsafe things described in https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3279231.

Hikari is not packaged as an RPM for Red Hat Enterprise Linux or Red Hat Software Collections. Applications using jackson-databind that do not also use com.zaxxer.hikari are not impacted by this vulnerability.\n\nA mitigation to this class of problem in jackson-databind is to not trigger polymorphic desrialization globally by using: objectMapper.enableDefaultTyping() and rather use @JsonTypeInfo on the class property to explicitly define the type information. For more information on this issue please refer to https://www.github.com/mbechler/marshalsec/blob/master/marshalsec.pdf?raw=true"
