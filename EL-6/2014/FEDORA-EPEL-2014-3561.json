						"thetext": "This ticket is mostly a tracker for a proposal: \"support for PHP WebApp with Nginx (out-of-the-box)\". Open for discussion, feedback.\n\nFox now most webapp provides a httpd configuration and work \"out-of-the-box\" with http + mod_php.\n\nGoal: change packaging of nginx + php + webapp to allow the same thing.\n\nIssue: \n- most important thing is to be able to drop a working configuration with php-fpm, and with every webapp, including a \"global\" alias.\n- include conf.d/*conf is at http level, so can contains \"server\" definition, but cannot contains \"location\"\n\n\nChange proposal\n\n1/ create a minimal subpackage \"nginx-filesystem\" (as httpd-filesystem) to have ownership on configuration/content directories, without having to require nginx (so a webapp can drop a file in both httpd and nginx configuration dir)\n\n    Requires: httpd-filesystem, nginx-filesystem, webserver\n\n\n2/ move the default server configuration in /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf\n\nthis is not mandatory, but can make things simpler.\n\n3/ move index directive out of location\n\nthis allow override (in global includes)\n\n4/ global includes\n\nBefore default location, for global definition at \"server\" level\n\n   include global.d/*.conf;\n\n5/ php-fpm => /etc/nginx/fpm.conf\n\nConfiguration for the default FastCGI server\n\n    # PHP-FPM FastCGI server\n    fastcgi_pass   127.0.0.1:9000;\n\nAnd Requires: nginx-filesystem\n\n6/ php-fpm /etc/nginx/global.d/99-php.conf\n\nNeed a numerical prefix to ensure load order (after the webapp)\n\n  # pass the PHP scripts to FastCGI server\n  #\n  # See fpm.conf for adress/port\n  #\n  index index.php;\n\n  location ~ \\.php$ {\n    root           html;\n    fastcgi_intercept_errors on;\n    fastcgi_index  index.php;\n    include        fastcgi_params;\n    include        fpm.conf;\n    fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_FILENAME  $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;\n  }\n\n===> with this change, when nginx + php-fpm are installed, php script will work out-of-the-box (for scripts in documentroot)\n\n7/ phpMyAdmin (well kown webapp, for example, PoC)\n\n- add the /etc/nginx/global.d/phpMyAdmin.conf\n\n  location /phpMyAdmin/\n  {\n      alias /usr/share/phpMyAdmin/;\n  }\n  location ~ ^/phpMyAdmin/(.+\\.php)$\n  {\n    fastcgi_intercept_errors on;\n    include        fastcgi_params;\n    include        fpm.conf;\n    fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_FILENAME  /usr/share$fastcgi_script_name;\n  }\n\nNotice: if a web add use php_* directive in http config file, those must be conditional, so the webapp could work with\n- apache + mod_php\n- apache + php-fpm\n- nginx + php-fpm\n\n===> phpMyAdmin should also work \"out-of-the-box\"\n\n\nNotice, I'm not a nginx expert, so perhaps we can do it simpler. But, this is only a quick and dirty PoC, and from my test, it works"

But perhaps people think is is better to provide everything disabled and let sysadmin manage their own configuration (and fall in the common configuration and security mistakes).\n\nPerhaps it will be a good idea to ask some upstream guy to review this proposal.\n\nSome people ask me to propose this as a feature for F22, but I don't want to own such a feature. This is a nginx one, I can help (on the PHP and webapp side), but obviously cannot do all the work.\n\nNow, if nginx owner are not interested, feel free to close this tracker as \"wontfix\"."
