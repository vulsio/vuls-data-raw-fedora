The CVE-2012-3509 flaw is believed to be able to cause arbitrary code execution. To actually reach this it would not be a trivial task though.\n\n2) If you are asking if gdb packages (since embedding libiberty code) are prone to arbitrary code execution, then the reply would be no. The actual exploitation depends on the 'code around' processing result of bfd_alloc2() / _objalloc_alloc and from what I can tell so far for gdb case, the resulting buffer is under-allocated, but the subsequent routine is just zero-ying its content at:\n\n  #2  setup_group (newsect=0x29a9bf0, hdr=0x29b2690, abfd=0x297a960) at ../../bfd/elf.c:607\n\nroutine, so explicitly for gdb this could not allow arbitrary code execution.\n\n> \n> IMO it is not, therefore it is a normal uninteresting crasher bug which has\n> been fixed upstream now and which is IMO not even worth a backport.

But for the rest of possibly affected packages the potential impact still needs to be investigated (to either confirm the danger or disprove it like in gdb case)."

						"thetext": "Description of problem:\n\nlibiberty is a collection of functions that are used in a variety of GNU projects. It is designed to be bundled into consuming applications. Unfortunately, one of the functions provided by libiberty has recently been the subject of a CVE https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=849693 . Whenever that happens we have to have packagers of all the consuming applications analyze their package's use of libiberty to decide whether they're affected or not. If affected, the bundled libiberty code needs to be updated.\n\nYou can fix this issue in one of the following ways:\n\n* Patch the libiberty _objalloc_alloc() code to perform the required overflow checking. This may be less work than analyzing the code to see if it's vulnerable and may also save you from future headaches because you might not know if your upstream has changed its code to start using the _objalloc_alloc() function in the future. You can find libiberty upstream's patch for this issue here: ​\nhttp://gcc.gnu.org/viewcvs/gcc/trunk/libiberty/objalloc.c?r1=184997&r2=191413\n \n* Analyze your package's code to see if the _objalloc_alloc() function in libiberty/objalloc.c is vulnerable. If so, check whether your package compiles it in and uses the _objalloc_alloc() from libiberty.  If so, you may further analyze the package code to see if invalid input can be passed to _objalloc_alloc() and if so, if that input can cause any problems for the application. If that's all true, then you must fix the code in question. If your code is not affected you can close this bug with an explanation of why the _objalloc_alloc() flaw doesn't affect your code.  You can verify if your code makes use of _objalloc_alloc() using this recipe:\n\n\n# yum install ${Your packages' and their subpackages'}-debuginfo\n$ nm /usr/lib/debug/usr/bin/${Your packages' binaries}.debug | grep -w _objalloc_alloc\n00000000005d85c0 T _objalloc_alloc\n\nIf you see lines containing _objalloc_alloc then your code makes use of the problematic code and is potentially affected."
