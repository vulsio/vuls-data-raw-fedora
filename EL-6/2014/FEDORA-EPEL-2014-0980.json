The original patch only modified the type of the column parameter to the roll/unroll functions, changing it from int to size_t to guard against integer overflow.  However, there are code paths that call yaml_parser_unroll_indent with a column of -1 in order to reset the parser back to the initial indention.  Since the column is now of type size_t and thus unsigned, passing a column value of -1 caused the column to underflow in this case.\n\nThis new patch modifies the roll/unroll functions to handle the -1 indent as a special case.  In addition, it adds a new function, yaml_parser_reset_indent.  It is nearly an exact copy of yaml_parser_unroll_indent, except it does not take a column parameter.  Instead it unrolls to a literal -1 indention, which does not suffer from the underflow.\n\nCode paths that previously called yaml_parser_unroll_indent with a column of -1 are updated to call the new yaml_parser_reset_indent function instead.\n\nWith this patch instead of the original:\n\n- `make check` still passes\n\n- The reproducer script completes successfully with exit code 0\n\n- The issue raised by John Haxby has been corrected and exits with SUCCESS"

The original patch only modified the type of the column parameter to the roll/unroll functions, changing it from int to size_t to guard against integer overflow.  However, there are code paths that call yaml_parser_unroll_indent with a column of -1 in order to reset the parser back to the initial indention.  Since the column is now of type size_t and thus unsigned, passing a column value of -1 caused the column to underflow in this case.\n\nThis new patch modifies the roll/unroll functions to handle the -1 indent as a special case.  In addition, it adds a new function, yaml_parser_reset_indent.  It is nearly an exact copy of yaml_parser_unroll_indent, except it does not take a column parameter.  Instead it unrolls to a literal -1 indention, which does not suffer from the underflow.\n\nCode paths that previously called yaml_parser_unroll_indent with a column of -1 are updated to call the new yaml_parser_reset_indent function instead.\n\nWith this patch instead of the original:\n\n- `make check` still passes\n\n- The reproducer script completes successfully with exit code 0\n\n- The issue raised by John Haxby has been corrected and exits with SUCCESS"

The vulnerability is caused by lack of proper expansion for the string passed to the yaml_parser_scan_uri_escapes() function. A specially crafted YAML file, with a long sequence of percent-encoded characters in a URL, can be used to trigger the overflow.",
