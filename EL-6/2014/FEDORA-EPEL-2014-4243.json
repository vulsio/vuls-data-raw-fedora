All rhels have this.\n\nThis is the TLS renegotiation SCSV which is different than the TLS fallback SCSV. However, the attack as I understand it does not apply on clients that rely on the TLS protocol negotiation. It applies to clients that do the \"browser\"-like negotiation which is to connect using TLS1.2, if that doesn't work, discard everything, and retry TLS 1.1... and so on until you do SSL 3.0.\n\nGnuTLS does not provide an API to do that trickery, and does not even discuss that as an option. I think that this attack affects mostly browsers rather than applications that properly use TLS/SSL."

								"thetext": "Note that there are two problems outlined in the paper linked in comment 0:\n\n- efficient padding oracle attack against SSL 3.0 CBC cipher suites\n- lack of ways to avoid MITM forced fallback in applications that implement re-connect SSL/TLS version fallback mechanism\n\n\nThe SSL 3.0 problem is yet another attack against the \"authenticate-then-encrypt\" constructions used by block ciphers in the cipher block chaining (CBC) mode, as used in SSL and TLS.  Previous attacks included BEAST / CVE-2011-3389 (bug 737506) or Lucky13 / CVE-2013-0169 (bug 907589).  The paper describes that when using SSL 3.0, only as little as 256 connections may be required to reliably decrypt one byte of cipher text.\n\nThe attack is similar to the BEAST attack - it requires that a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacker can make victim SSL client to repeatedly send the same secret information over SSL connection, mixed with attacker provided data.  Web browser is an example of such use case.  Attacker's script can make victim's browser send repeated requests to a target server.  Each request containing attacker controlled data (such as target path and GET/POST data) as well as secret information attacker wants to recover (such as authentication cookie).  A more detailed description of the browser attack can be found in the Adam Langley's blog post:\n\nhttps://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/10/14/poodle.html\n\nSSL 3.0 protocol issues that allow this attack are addressed, to some degree, in TLS - TLS 1.0 specifies format of message padding bytes, newer TLS versions define cipher suites using different modes.\n\nImplementations of SSL 3.0 protocols should be expected to get any fix to address this protocol problem.  Patches linked in comment 2 and comment 3 do not fix this issue, see below for more information on what they do.  One alternative may be to restrict use of CBC block ciphers with SSL 3.0, which leaves stream cipher RC4 as the only alternative.  RC4 has other known issues (see CVE-2013-2566 / bug 921947) and its use is discouraged.  It seems the only option will be to abandon the use of SSL 3.0.  See the Red Hat Knowledgebase article linked in comment 1 for instructions on how to disable the use of SSL 3.0 in various applications shipped as part of Red Hat products.\n\nAs SSL/TLS libraries used today usually support at least TLS version 1.0 (which is newer protocol version than SSL 3.0 despite having lower version number), often up to the currently latest TLS version 1.2, TLS 1.0 or newer is usually negotiated when SSL/TLS connection is created.  SSL/TLS protocols include a fallback mechanism which allows client and server to communicate even if the highest SSL/TLS version they support is not the same.  Client indicates the highest version it supports in its ClientHello handshake message, and server picks the highest version supported by both peers and communicates it back to client in its ServerHello handshake message.  SSL/TLS protocols implement protections to prevent MITM attacker from being able to tamper with handshake messages to force the use of the protocol version lower than the highest version supported by both client and server.  Which leads us to the second problem...\n\n\nCertain applications, most notably web browsers such as Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome, implement different fallback mechanism for compatibility reasons.  Some SSL/TLS implementation do not correctly handle cases when connecting client supports newer TLS protocol version than supported by the client, or when certain TLS extensions are used.  Instead of negotiating the highest TLS version supported by server, connection attempt may fail.  As a workaround, a web browser may attempt to re-connect with certain protocol versions disabled.  For example, browser may initially connect claiming TLS 1.2 as the highest supported version, and subsequently reconnect claiming only TLS 1.1, TLS 1.0 or eventually SSL 3.0 as the highest supported version until connection attempt succeeds.\n\nThis fallback mechanism makes it trivial for MITM attacker to force browser to use specific SSL/TLS version when talking to a web server.  Even if both client and server support TLS 1.2, they can be forced to use SSL 3.0 if both allow that protocol version, which makes it possible to mount a padding oracle attack as described above.\n\nPatches in comment 2 and comment 3, which implement the TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV protection defined in the following RFC draft:\n\nhttps://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tls-downgrade-scsv-00\n\naims to make this fallback mechanism safer by making it possible for applications to indicate if they are doing version fallback and that they can speak newer SSL/TLS protocol version.  Note that those fixes are insufficient if only applied to SSL/TLS libraries, client applications need to be modified to take advantage of the new feature.  The following conditions must be met to make TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV protection work:\n\n- SSL/TLS library used by an application doing re-connect fallback needs to implement TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV\n- application must be modified to instruct the SSL/TLS library to send TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV when doing fallback to older protocol version\n- SSL/TLS library used by the server must support TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV, no change to the server application is required\n\nIf server sees a connection attempt using SSL/TLS version lower than the highest protocol version it supports and that also includes TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV, it rejects the connection.\n\nNote that is re-connect version fallback commonly found in web browsers is uncommon in other applications or SSL/TLS libraries (i.e. it is not done by OpenSSL, NSS or GnuTLS)."

Updates add support for disabling specific SSL/TLS protocol versions using the jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms security property, and they also update the master security properties file, java.security, to add SSLv3 to the list of algorithms that are disabled by default.\n\nUsers who need to re-enable SSL 3.0 protocol support in OpenJDK or Oracle JDK can do so using one of the following ways:\n\n* Change the master security properties file to not include SSLv3 in the list of disabled algorithms.  The java.security files for each JDK can be found at the following path:\n\n  /usr/lib/jvm/*/jre/lib/security/java.security\n\nThe sub-directory under /usr/lib/jvm contains package name (such as java-1.7.0-openjdk or java-1.7.0-oracle) possibly followed by package version or architecture (depending on the JDK and its version).\n\nNote that the change to the file will affect all applications using given JDK.  Local changes to the file will also cause new java.security versions to be installed as java.security.rpmnew if future updates change packaged version, requiring manual merge of changes.\n\n* Re-enable SSLv3 support only for specific application or applications that require it.  Create a new security properties file that will override the default jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms setting from the master java.security, and use the java.security.properties system property to make Java read the file in addition to the master security properties file.  Example:\n\n  $ cat enable-ssl3.security \n  jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms=\n\n  $ java -Djava.security.properties=/path/to/enable-ssl3.security ...\n\nNote that this only works if the master security properties file sets the security.overridePropertiesFile security property to true.  That is the default setting in all OpenJDK and Oracle JDK packages shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux."

	"notes": "* Fri Nov 21 2014 Jeffrey C. Ollie <jeff@ocjtech.us> - 1.8.32.1-1:\r\n- The Asterisk Development Team has announced security releases for Certified\r\n- Asterisk 1.8.28 and 11.6 and Asterisk 1.8, 11, 12, and 13. The available\r\n- security releases are released as versions 1.8.28-cert3, 11.6-cert8, 1.8.32.1,\r\n- 11.14.1, 12.7.1, and 13.0.1.\r\n-\r\n- These releases are available for immediate download at\r\n- http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/releases\r\n-\r\n- The release of these versions resolves the following security vulnerabilities:\r\n-\r\n- * AST-2014-012: Unauthorized access in the presence of ACLs with mixed IP\r\n-   address families\r\n-\r\n-   Many modules in Asterisk that service incoming IP traffic have ACL options\r\n-   (\"permit\" and \"deny\") that can be used to whitelist or blacklist address\r\n-   ranges. A bug has been discovered where the address family of incoming\r\n-   packets is only compared to the IP address family of the first entry in the\r\n-   list of access control rules. If the source IP address for an incoming\r\n-   packet is not of the same address as the first ACL entry, that packet\r\n-   bypasses all ACL rules.\r\n-\r\n- * AST-2014-018: Permission Escalation through DB dialplan function\r\n-\r\n-   The DB dialplan function when executed from an external protocol, such as AMI,\r\n-   could result in a privilege escalation. Users with a lower class authorization\r\n-   in AMI can access the internal Asterisk database without the required SYSTEM\r\n-   class authorization.\r\n-\r\n- In addition, the release of 11.6-cert8 and 11.14.1 resolves the following\r\n- security vulnerability:\r\n-\r\n- * AST-2014-014: High call load with ConfBridge can result in resource exhaustion\r\n-\r\n-   The ConfBridge application uses an internal bridging API to implement\r\n-   conference bridges. This internal API uses a state model for channels within\r\n-   the conference bridge and transitions between states as different things\r\n-   occur. Unload load it is possible for some state transitions to be delayed\r\n-   causing the channel to transition from being hung up to waiting for media. As\r\n-   the channel has been hung up remotely no further media will arrive and the\r\n-   channel will stay within ConfBridge indefinitely.\r\n-\r\n- In addition, the release of 11.6-cert8, 11.14.1, 12.7.1, and 13.0.1 resolves\r\n- the following security vulnerability:\r\n-\r\n- * AST-2014-017: Permission Escalation via ConfBridge dialplan function and\r\n-                 AMI ConfbridgeStartRecord Action\r\n-\r\n-   The CONFBRIDGE dialplan function when executed from an external protocol (such\r\n-   as AMI) can result in a privilege escalation as certain options within that\r\n-   function can affect the underlying system. Additionally, the AMI\r\n-   ConfbridgeStartRecord action has options that would allow modification of the\r\n-   underlying system, and does not require SYSTEM class authorization in AMI.\r\n-\r\n- Finally, the release of 12.7.1 and 13.0.1 resolves the following security\r\n- vulnerabilities:\r\n-\r\n- * AST-2014-013: Unauthorized access in the presence of ACLs in the PJSIP stack\r\n-\r\n-   The Asterisk module res_pjsip provides the ability to configure ACLs that may\r\n-   be used to reject SIP requests from various hosts. However, the module\r\n-   currently fails to create and apply the ACLs defined in its configuration\r\n-   file on initial module load.\r\n-\r\n- * AST-2014-015: Remote crash vulnerability in PJSIP channel driver\r\n-\r\n-   The chan_pjsip channel driver uses a queue approach for relating to SIP\r\n-   sessions. There exists a race condition where actions may be queued to answer\r\n-   a session or send ringing after a SIP session has been terminated using a\r\n-   CANCEL request. The code will incorrectly assume that the SIP session is still\r\n-   active and attempt to send the SIP response. The PJSIP library does not\r\n-   expect the SIP session to be in the disconnected state when sending the\r\n-   response and asserts.\r\n-\r\n- * AST-2014-016: Remote crash vulnerability in PJSIP channel driver\r\n-\r\n-   When handling an INVITE with Replaces message the res_pjsip_refer module\r\n-   incorrectly assumes that it will be operating on a channel that has just been\r\n-   created. If the INVITE with Replaces message is sent in-dialog after a session\r\n-   has been established this assumption will be incorrect. The res_pjsip_refer\r\n-   module will then hang up a channel that is actually owned by another thread.\r\n-   When this other thread attempts to use the just hung up channel it will end up\r\n-   using a freed channel which will likely result in a crash.\r\n-\r\n- For more information about the details of these vulnerabilities, please read\r\n- security advisories AST-2014-012, AST-2014-013, AST-2014-014, AST-2014-015,\r\n- AST-2014-016, AST-2014-017, and AST-2014-018, which were released at the same\r\n- time as this announcement.\r\n-\r\n- For a full list of changes in the current releases, please see the ChangeLogs:\r\n-\r\n- http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/certified-asterisk/releases/ChangeLog-1.8.28-cert3\r\n- http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/certified-asterisk/releases/ChangeLog-11.6-cert8\r\n- http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/releases/ChangeLog-1.8.32.1\r\n- http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/releases/ChangeLog-11.14.1\r\n- http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/releases/ChangeLog-12.7.1\r\n- http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/releases/ChangeLog-13.0.1\r\n-\r\n- The security advisories are available at:\r\n-\r\n-  * http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/security/AST-2014-012.pdf\r\n-  * http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/security/AST-2014-013.pdf\r\n-  * http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/security/AST-2014-014.pdf\r\n-  * http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/security/AST-2014-015.pdf\r\n-  * http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/security/AST-2014-016.pdf\r\n-  * http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/security/AST-2014-017.pdf\r\n-  * http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/security/AST-2014-018.pdf\r\n* Fri Nov 21 2014 Jeffrey C.

Ollie <jeff@ocjtech.us> - 1.8.31.1-1:\r\n- The Asterisk Development Team has announced security releases for Certified\r\n- Asterisk 1.8.28 and 11.6 and Asterisk 1.8, 11, 12, and 13. The available\r\n- security releases are released as versions 1.8.28-cert2, 11.6-cert7, 1.8.31.1,\r\n- 11.13.1, 12.6.1, and 13.0.0-beta3.\r\n-\r\n- These releases are available for immediate download at\r\n- http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/releases\r\n-\r\n- The release of these versions resolves the following security vulnerability:\r\n-\r\n- * AST-2014-011: Asterisk Susceptibility to POODLE Vulnerability\r\n-\r\n-   Asterisk is susceptible to the POODLE vulnerability in two ways:\r\n-   1) The res_jabber and res_xmpp module both use SSLv3 exclusively for their\r\n-      encrypted connections.\r\n-   2) The core TLS handling in Asterisk, which is used by the chan_sip channel\r\n-      driver, Asterisk Manager Interface (AMI), and Asterisk HTTP Server, by\r\n-      default allow a TLS connection to fallback to SSLv3. This allows for a\r\n-      MITM to potentially force a connection to fallback to SSLv3, exposing it\r\n-      to the POODLE vulnerability.\r\n-\r\n-   These issues have been resolved in the versions released in conjunction with\r\n-   this security advisory.\r\n-\r\n- For more information about the details of this vulnerability, please read\r\n- security advisory AST-2014-011, which was released at the same time as this\r\n- announcement.\r\n-\r\n- For a full list of changes in the current releases, please see the ChangeLogs:\r\n-\r\n- http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/certified-asterisk/releases/ChangeLog-1.8.28-cert2\r\n- http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/certified-asterisk/releases/ChangeLog-11.6-cert7\r\n- http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/releases/ChangeLog-1.8.31.1\r\n- http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/releases/ChangeLog-11.13.1\r\n- http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/releases/ChangeLog-12.6.1\r\n- http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/releases/ChangeLog-13.0.0-beta3\r\n-\r\n- The security advisory is available at:\r\n-\r\n-  * http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/security/AST-2014-011.pdf\r\n",
