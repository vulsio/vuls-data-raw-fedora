						"thetext": "Description of problem:\nx2go server and client setup and working easily.\n\nHowever I noticed that some programs no longer run even though they are installed.\nUpon further investigation turns out to be a problem with the PATH environment variable.\nIt is set correct when I login via ssh and with NoMachine but not via x2go.\n/etc/profile is properly called from /etc/x2go/Xsession and sources it and the PATH (and other) variable(s) get set but then a command is called that does not exist $(tempfile) that causes the script to exit prematurely and the session starts apparently abandoning the environment.  Commenting line 101 out causes the session to start and exit immediately.  Only after changing the final \"exit 0\" o an \"exit 1\" does the session start, but even though echoing the contents of $PATH from that script outputs the correct PATH contents to ~/.xsession-x2go-errors, within the session only a stripped down PATH is set and many other variables are missing.\n\n\nVersion-Release number of selected component (if applicable):\nx2goserver-4.0.1.6-5.fc19.x86_64\n\nHow reproducible:\nEvery time.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Install x2goserver and x2goclient\n2. Use client to connect to remote server\n3. Check PATH variable and notice it is not the same as a raw SSH shell session.\n\nActual results:\nx2go Xsession script not running correctly and /etc/profile variable not being parsed and kept correctly.\n\nExpected results:\nMostly the same behavior as NoMachine or any normal login environment.\n\nAdditional info:\nOutput of said log:\nXSession-x2go: X session started for sly at Thu Dec  5 17:36:39 EST 2013\n/etc/x2go/Xsession: line 101: tempfile: command not found\n\nEchoing $PATH and $HOSTNAME from within Xsession shows correct variable contents:\nXSession-x2go: X session started for sly at Thu Dec  5 17:21:44 EST 2013\n/usr/lib64/qt-3.3/bin:/usr/NX/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin\nKentsfield.MidnightNetworks.com\n\nBut within session no $HOSTNAME and $PATH is only:\n/usr/lib64/qt-3.3/bin:/usr/NX/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin"

The change is simple as such:\n\n89a90\n> \n177,179c178\n< \t\tif [ -r $file ]; then\n< \t\t\t. $file\n< \t\tfi\n---\n> \t\t. $file\n\nThanks again for the update!  With that simple change I can confirm it works.  It may be preferable to use some sort of error handling so no errors incurred by other commands (in this case caused by a simple benign no files found in the directory referenced being called) causes the script to bomb and loose the environment that it was trying to pull in."

	"notes": "This release pulls in all changes that got introduced in the Baikal LTS release 4.0.0.8, including a severe vulnerability in\r\nx2gocleansessions. Gains of the LTS version 4.0.0.8 of x2goserver are:\r\n\r\n   o Improve parsing of the NX session.log file. Fix session\r\n     suspending/resuming when in fails in some occasions.\r\n   o Fix severe vulnerability in x2gocleansessions.\r\n   o Sanitize session ID string, port numbers, display numbers\r\n     and agent PID numbers before writing them as strings to the\r\n     session DB.\r\n\r\nPlease note::: This release fixes a severe vulnerability in X2Go Server that allowed an attacker with user permissions to gain root access tothe X2Go Server machine.  Everyone, please upgrade your X2Go Server installations.\r\n\r\nNew gains of the version 4.0.1.10 of x2goserver are:\r\n\r\n   o Fix x2goresume-session that we broke in 4.0.1.9.\r\n   o Ship x2goserver-fmbindings\r\n   o Allow enabling/disabling of TCP listening of x2goagent.\n- Disable Xsession support for now - Debian specific (Bug #1038834)\r\n\r\nUpdate to 4.0.1.9 - incorporate changes from 4.0.0.7 LTS bugfix release.\r\n\r\n- Drop incorrect keyboard patch- Use mktemp instead of tempfile\r\n- Fix Xsession.d link creation\r\n- Add patch to fix keyboard setting (bug #1033876)\r\n\r\nUpdate to 4.0.1.8:\r\n\r\n- Fix resizing when resuming sessions.\r\n- Fix automatic keyboard setup (via x2gosetkeyboard) while resuming a session. (Fixes: #285).\r\n- Provide sudoers.d/x2goserver file that allows sudoed commands under KDE (by pertaining the env var QT_GRAPHICSSYSTEM. (Fixes: #276).\r\n- With PostgreSQL as session db backend, prevent the root user from launching sessions. Also, prevent x2gouser_root from being added as a PostgreSQL user. (Fixes: #310).\r\n- Execute DB status changes as late as possible during suspend / terminate.\r\n- Start/resume rootless sessions without geometry parameter.  Esp. using X2GO_GEOMETRY=fullscreen for rootless sessions lead to an extra 1x1 px session window (nxagentCreateIconWindow in nxagent's Window.c).\r\n- Typo fix in x2goruncommand (for MATE session startup).\r\n- Make umask that is used when mounting client-side folders via SSHFS configurable in x2goserver.conf. (Fixes: #331).\r\n- Use bash-builtin 'type' instead of to be avoided 'which'.  (Fixes: #305).\n- Disable Xsession support for now - Debian specific (Bug #1038834)\r\n\r\nUpdate to 4.0.1.9 - incorporate changes from 4.0.0.7 LTS bugfix release.\r\n\r\n- Drop incorrect keyboard patch\r\n- Use mktemp instead of tempfile\r\n- Fix Xsession.d link creation\r\n- Add patch to fix keyboard setting (bug #1033876)\r\n\r\nUpdate to 4.0.1.8:\r\n\r\n- Fix resizing when resuming sessions.\r\n- Fix automatic keyboard setup (via x2gosetkeyboard) while resuming a session.
