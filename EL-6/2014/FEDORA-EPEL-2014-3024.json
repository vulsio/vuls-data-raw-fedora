This additional patch is required, as rsync 3.x overloads -e command line argument - when --server option is also specified, -e is used to pass protocol version and additional flags.  Additional info on the rsync 3.x support can be found in the following bugs:\n\nhttps://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=485946\nhttp://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=471803\n\nThis patch has never been accepted upstream, hence upstream versions of rssh (up to the current 2.3.3) were not affected by this problem.  rssh packages in EPEL-5 also do not include this patch yet (bug 878113) and are not affected."
