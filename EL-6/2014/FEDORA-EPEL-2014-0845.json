But during the read or write execution, certain diaplan functions do much more. For example, reading the SHELL() function can execute arbitrary commands on the system Asterisk is running on. Writing to the FILE() function can change any file that Asterisk has write access to.\n\nWhen these functions are executed from an external protocol, that execution could result in a privilege escalation.\n\nReferences:\nhttp://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=732355\nhttp://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/security/AST-2013-007.html\n\nPatch:\n1.8: http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/security/AST-2013-007-1.8.diff\n11: http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/security/AST-2013-007-11.diff"
