It's writing a long integer in a way that at least 6 digits are always printed, prefixed with zeros if needed (e.g. L000001, L000123, or L1234567).  Adding space for 'L' and terminating '\\0', that implies there is at least 4 byte buffer overflow whenever that code is reached.  Depending on actual memory layout, this may only clobber other local variables in WritePSDImage().\n\nThe maximum overflow is architecture dependent.  It seems the maximum number of digits is written if layer_count is LONG_MIN, resulting in layer_name being L-2147483648 (32bit) or L-9223372036854775808 (64bit), yielding the maximum of 18 byte overflow.  As the value printed is layer counter, it may not be possible to provide input image with that many layers.  Practical overflow may not be much longer than the overflow that happens in the non-malicious case mentioned above.\n\nOlder ImageMagick versions have this format string instead \"L%02ld\", so it does not always overflow, it only starts to overflow with 100 layers.\n\nUpstream commit:\nhttp://trac.imagemagick.org/changeset/13736"

						"thetext": "As noted in IRC, I believe what Murray found (second and third hunk) is a different issue. Tomas' commit identifies the patch mentioned in the Secunia advisory.\n\nThe fix is in the DecodePSDPixels function and looks RLE-related. RLE is a simple compression using pairs of bytes, first the number of elements, then the value for an element. A pair of [3, a] would produce \"aaa\" on decompression.\n\nRLE can overflow at the pre-allocated target buffer if no size check for the uncompressed length of the current pair is performed. A simple example is allocating a buffer of size 4, then having a encoding pair of [3, a] and [256, b]. After writing 'aaa' the buffer still has room, so (current_index < buffer_length) is true and we decompress the next pair, writing 255 bytes beyond the buffer boundary. That's exactly what happens here.\n\nIn this code: compact_pixels is the set of RLE pairs, number_pixels is the length of the buffer. i is the current pixel index, pixel points to the current characters. Buffer overflow can happen when (i >= number_pixels - 256).\n\nThe patch fixed this by capping the length of the decompressed set to the remainder.\n\nThe other size checks are ok, so an exploit would only be able use one packet to write past the buffer boundary, and the byte values aren't completely arbitrary but somewhat limited by the format. How to exploit that requires more creativity than I have. Max overflow is 256 bytes."

It's writing a long integer in a way that at least 6 digits are always printed, prefixed with zeros if needed (e.g. L000001, L000123, or L1234567).  Adding space for 'L' and terminating '\\0', that implies there is at least 4 byte buffer overflow whenever that code is reached.  Depending on actual memory layout, this may only clobber other local variables in WritePSDImage().\n\nThe maximum overflow is architecture dependent.  It seems the maximum number of digits is written if layer_count is LONG_MIN, resulting in layer_name being L-2147483648 (32bit) or L-9223372036854775808 (64bit), yielding the maximum of 18 byte overflow.  As the value printed is layer counter, it may not be possible to provide input image with that many layers.  Practical overflow may not be much longer than the overflow that happens in the non-malicious case mentioned above.\n\nOlder ImageMagick versions have this format string instead \"L%02ld\", so it does not always overflow, it only starts to overflow with 100 layers.\n\nUpstream commit:\nhttp://trac.imagemagick.org/changeset/13736"

								"thetext": "As noted in IRC, I believe what Murray found (second and third hunk) is a different issue. Tomas' commit identifies the patch mentioned in the Secunia advisory.\n\nThe fix is in the DecodePSDPixels function and looks RLE-related. RLE is a simple compression using pairs of bytes, first the number of elements, then the value for an element. A pair of [3, a] would produce \"aaa\" on decompression.\n\nRLE can overflow at the pre-allocated target buffer if no size check for the uncompressed length of the current pair is performed. A simple example is allocating a buffer of size 4, then having a encoding pair of [3, a] and [256, b]. After writing 'aaa' the buffer still has room, so (current_index < buffer_length) is true and we decompress the next pair, writing 255 bytes beyond the buffer boundary. That's exactly what happens here.\n\nIn this code: compact_pixels is the set of RLE pairs, number_pixels is the length of the buffer. i is the current pixel index, pixel points to the current characters. Buffer overflow can happen when (i >= number_pixels - 256).\n\nThe patch fixed this by capping the length of the decompressed set to the remainder.\n\nThe other size checks are ok, so an exploit would only be able use one packet to write past the buffer boundary, and the byte values aren't completely arbitrary but somewhat limited by the format. How to exploit that requires more creativity than I have. Max overflow is 256 bytes."
