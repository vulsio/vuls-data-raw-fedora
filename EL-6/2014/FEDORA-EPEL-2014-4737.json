On my system it looks like this: (the OS is RHEL Workstation 6.5 Santiago)\n# rpm -q device-mapper-libs\ndevice-mapper-libs-1.02.79-8.el6.x86_64\n\nSo the rpm exists, but the version is too old and can't be updated.\n\nWhat exact of Centos did you check? My guess is that it's 6.6, not 6.5\n\nI see also here it's 1.02.79 for Centos 6.5:\nhttp://rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=device-mapper-libs\n\n2. I installed as a workaround for now docker 1.2 that didn't have this requirement. But I'll keep in mind your suggested 1.4 as well for future, thanks."

If anyone knows how to make this work, please let me know.\n\nAnyway, the updated rpm (without min NVR for device-mapper-libs) is here: https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org//work/tasks/2787/8392787/docker-io-1.4.0-2.el6.x86_64.rpm .

Also, see Comment 4, i don't see a way to set different min NVRs for 6.5 and 6.6 (If you know how to, please let me know or send me a patch). So, it seems best to not enforce min NVR, but leave it upto the 6.5 user to upgrade it.\n\nI'll update the upstream documentation to reflect the issue with 6.5"
