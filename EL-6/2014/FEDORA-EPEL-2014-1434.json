The original report from upstream:\n\n\"\"\nIn certain situations, Django may allow caches to store private data\nrelated to a particular session and then serve that data to requests\nwith a different session, or no session at all. This can both lead to\ninformation disclosure, and can be a vector for cache poisoning.\n\nWhen using Django sessions, Django will set a ``Vary: Cookie`` header\nto ensure caches do not serve cached data to requests from other\nsessions. However, older versions of Internet Explorer (most likely\nonly Internet Explorer 6, and Internet Explorer 7 if run on Windows XP\nor Windows Server 2003) are unable to handle the ``Vary`` header in\ncombination with many content types. Therefore, Django would remove\nthe header if the request was made by Internet Explorer.\n\nTo remedy this, the special behavior for these older Internet\nExplorer versions has been removed, and the ``Vary`` header is no\nlonger stripped from the response. In addition, modifications to the\n``Cache-Control`` header for all Internet Explorer requests with a\n``Content-Disposition`` header, have also been removed as they were\nfound to have similar issues.\n\"\"\n\nThis issue affects Django versions 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, and 1.7.

The original report from upstream:\n\n\"\"\nThe validation for redirects did not correctly validate some malformed\nURLs, which are accepted by some browsers. This allows a user to be\nredirected to an unsafe URL unexpectedly.\n\nDjango relies on user input in some cases (e.g.\n:func:`django.contrib.auth.views.login`, ``django.contrib.comments``,\nand :doc:`i18n </topics/i18n/index>`) to redirect the user to an \"on\nsuccess\" URL. The security checks for these redirects (namely\n``django.util.http.is_safe_url()``) did not correctly validate some\nmalformed URLs, such as `http:\\\\\\\\\\\\djangoproject.com`, which are\naccepted by some browsers with more liberal URL parsing.\n\nTo remedy this, the validation in ``is_safe_url()`` has been tightened\nto be able to handle and correctly validate these malformed URLs.\n\"\"\n\nThis issue affects Django versions 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, and 1.7.

The original report from upstream:\n\n\"\"\nThe validation for redirects did not correctly validate some malformed\nURLs, which are accepted by some browsers. This allows a user to be\nredirected to an unsafe URL unexpectedly.\n\nDjango relies on user input in some cases (e.g.\n:func:`django.contrib.auth.views.login`, ``django.contrib.comments``,\nand :doc:`i18n </topics/i18n/index>`) to redirect the user to an \"on\nsuccess\" URL. The security checks for these redirects (namely\n``django.util.http.is_safe_url()``) did not correctly validate some\nmalformed URLs, such as `http:\\\\\\\\\\\\djangoproject.com`, which are\naccepted by some browsers with more liberal URL parsing.\n\nTo remedy this, the validation in ``is_safe_url()`` has been tightened\nto be able to handle and correctly validate these malformed URLs.\n\"\"\n\nThis issue affects Django versions 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, and 1.7. It has been fixed in versions 1.4.13, 1.5.8, 1.6.5, and 1.7 beta 4.\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the upstream Django project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Peter Kuma and Gavin Wahl as the original reporters."
