If a local attacker were able to provide unsanitized data to a data source used by Exim for looking up a value, in certain situations, the data would be eval()'d twice.  This is not remotely exploitable and requires a user account on the Exim server, and an Exim configuration that does lookups against files to which the user has edit access.  The end result is that, if the conditions are true, arbitrary code could be executed as the exim user.
