Cross-site scripting vulnerability (PMASA-2016-16):\n\nA specially crafted attack could allow for special HTML characters to be passed as URL encoded values and displayed back as special characters in the page.\n\nAffects versions 4.4.x (prior to 4.4.15.6) and 4.6.x (prior to 4.6.2).\n\nUpstream patches:\n\n4.6 branch: https://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/commit/b061096abd992801fbbd805ef6ff74e627528780\n\n4.4 branch: https://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/commit/b061096abd992801fbbd805ef6ff74e627528780\n\n----------------------\n\n2. File Traversal Protection Bypass on Error Reporting (PMASA-2016-15):\n\nA specially crafted payload could result in the error reporting component exposing whether an arbitrary file exists on the file system and the size of that file.\n\nThe attacker must be able to intercept and modify the user's POST data and must be able to trigger a JavaScript error to the user.\n\nThis attack can be mitigated in affected installations by setting `$cfg['Servers'][$i]['SendErrorReports'] = 'never';`. Upgrading to a more recent development commit is suggested.\n\nOnly git 'master' development branch was affected.
