This runs through rssh (the restricted user’s shell), which attempts to verify the arguments are “secure.” We can control exactly which scp command is run on the server by supplying it as an argument to ssh. If rssh considers our invocation secure, it will execute that command.\n\nReferences:\n\nhttps://esnet-security.github.io/vulnerabilities/20190115_rssh\\\n\nUpstream issue:\n\nhttps://sourceforge.net/p/rssh/mailman/message/36519118/"

								"thetext": "A flaw was found in rssh. If rsync is built with popt (as it is in Debian), the popt library will attempt to open and parse ~/.popt on the server and interpret it  as configuration for command line option parsing.  If the client can rsync a .popt file to the home directory of the user protected with rssh, this allows arbitrary code execution on the server via several paths.  The most obvious is via the popt exec feature which execs an arbitrary program as an external option filter, but a more sneaky approach is through the popt alias feature which allows one to alias a benign option (such as --server) to one that will run arbitrary code (such as --rsh).\n\n\nReferences:\nhttps://sourceforge.net/p/rssh/mailman/message/36536555/"
