More about the change in the [Browser Compatibility](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/guide/dev_browsers.html) guide.\n* [#13398](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/13398): Renamed `CKEDITOR.fileTools.UploadsRepository` to [`CKEDITOR.fileTools.UploadRepository`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR.fileTools.uploadRepository.html) and changed all related properties.\n* [#13279](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/13279): Reviewed CSS vendor prefixes.\n* [#13454](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/13454): Removed unused `lang.image.alertUrl` token from the [Image](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/image) plugin.\n\n## CKEditor 4.5 Beta\n\nNew Features:\n\n* Clipboard (copy&paste, drag&drop) and file uploading features and improvements ([#11437](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/11437)).\n\n  * Major features:\n    * Support for dropping and pasting files into the editor was introduced. Through a set of new facades for native APIs it is now possible to easily intercept and process inserted files.\n    * [File upload tools](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR.fileTools.html) were introduced in order to simplify controlling the loading, uploading and handling server response, properly handle [new upload configuration](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.html#cfg-uploadUrl) options, etc.\n    * [Upload Image](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/uploadimage) widget was introduced to upload dropped images. A base class for the [upload widget](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR.fileTools.uploadWidgetDefinition.html) was exposed, too, to make it simple to create new types of upload widgets which can handle any type of dropped file, show the upload progress and update the content when the process is done. It also handles editing and undo/redo operations when a file is being uploaded and integrates with the [notification aggregator](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR.plugins.notificationAggregator.html) to show progress and success or error.\n    * All drag and drop operations were integrated with the editor. All dropped content is passed through the [`editor#paste`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#event-paste) event and a set of new editor events was introduced &mdash; [`dragstart`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#event-dragstart), [`drop`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#event-drop), [`dragend`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#event-dragend).\n    * The [Data Transfer](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR.plugins.clipboard.dataTransfer.html) facade was introduced to unify access to data in various types and files. [Data Transfer](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR.plugins.clipboard.dataTransfer.html) is now always available in the [`editor#paste`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#event-paste) event.\n    * Switched from the pastebin to using the native clipboard access whenever possible. This solved many issues related to pastebin such as unnecessary scrolling or data loss. Additionally, on copy and cut from the editor the clipboard data is set. Therefore, on paste the editor has access to clean data, undisturbed by the browsers.\n    * Drag and drop of inline and block widgets was integrated with the standard clipboard APIs. By listening to drag events you will thus be notified about widgets, too. This opens a possibility to filter pasted and dropped widgets.\n    * The [`editor#paste`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#event-paste) event can have the `range` parameter so it is possible to change the paste position in the listener or paste in the not selectable position. Also the [`editor.insertHtml()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#method-insertHtml) method now accepts `range` as an additional parameter.\n    * [#11621](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/11621): A configurable [paste filter](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.html#cfg-pasteFilter) was introduced. The filter is by default turned to `'semantic-content'` on Webkit and Blink for all pasted content coming from external sources because of the low quality of HTML that these engines put into the clipboard. Internal and cross-editor paste is safe due to the change explained in the previous point.\n\n  * Other changes and related fixes:\n    * [#12095](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/12095): On drag and copy of widgets [the same method](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#method-getSelectedHtml) is used to get selected HTML as in the normal case. Thanks to that styles applied to inline widgets are not lost.\n    * [#11219](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/11219): Fixed: Dragging a [captioned image](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/image2) does not fire the [`editor#paste`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#event-paste) event.\n    * [#9554](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/9554): [Webkit Mac] Fixed: Editor scrolls on paste.\n    * [#9898](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/9898): [Webkit&Divarea] Fixed: Pasting causes undesirable scrolling.\n    * [#11993](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/11993): [Chrome] Fixed: Pasting content scrolls the document.\n    * [#12613](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/12613): Show the user that they can not drop on editor UI (toolbar, bottom bar).\n    * [#12851](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/12851): [Blink/Webkit] Fixed: Formatting disappears when pasting content into cells.\n    * [#12914](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/12914): Fixed: Copy/Paste of table broken in `div`-based editor.\n\n  * Browser support.<br>Browser support for related features varies significantly (see http://caniuse.com/clipboard).\n    * File APIs needed to operate and file upload is not supported in Internet Explorer 9 and below.\n    * Only Chrome and Safari on Mac OS support setting custom data items in the clipboard, so currently it is possible to recognize the origin of the copied content in these browsers only. All drag and drop operations can be identified thanks to the new Data Transfer facade.\n    * No Internet Explorer browser supports the standard clipboard API which results in small glitches like where only plain text can be dropped from outside the editor. Thanks to the new Data Transfer facade, internal and cross-editor drag and drop supports the full range of data.\n    * Direct access to clipboard could only be implemented in Chrome, Safari on Mac OS, Opera and Firefox. In other browsers the pastebin must still be used.\n\n* [#12875](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/12875): Samples and toolbar configuration tools.\n  * The old set of samples shipped with every CKEditor package was replaced with a shiny new single-page sample. This change concluded a long term plan which started from introducing the [CKEditor SDK](https://sdk.ckeditor.com/) and [CKEditor Functionality Overview](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/guide/dev_features.html) section in the documentation which essentially redefined the old samples.\n  * Toolbar configurators with live previews were introduced. They will be shipped with every CKEditor package and are meant to help in configuring toolbar layouts.\n\n* [#10925](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/10925): The [Media Embed](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/embed) and [Semantic Media Embed](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/embedsemantic) plugins were introduced. Read more about the new features in the [Embedding Content](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/guide/dev_media_embed.html) article.\n* [#10931](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/10931): Added support for nesting widgets. It is now possible to insert one widget into another widget's nested editable. Note that unless nested editable's [allowed content](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_plugins_widget_nestedEditable_definition.html#property-allowedContent) is defined precisely, starting from CKEditor 4.5 some widget buttons may become enabled.

Thanks to [Steven Busse](https://github.com/sbusse)!\n\nChanges:\n\n* [#12858](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/12858): Basic [Spartan](http://blogs.windows.com/bloggingwindows/2015/03/30/introducing-project-spartan-the-new-browser-built-for-windows-10/) browser compatibility. Full compatibility will be introduced later, because at the moment Spartan is still too unstable to be used for tests and we see many changes from version to version.\n* [#12948](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/12948): The [`config.mathJaxLibrary`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.html#cfg-mathJaxLib) option does not default to the MathJax CDN any more.

Now, the `editor.insertElement()` method works on a higher level, which means that it saves undo snapshots and sets the selection after insertion. Use the [`editable.insertElementIntoRange()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editable.html#method-insertElementIntoRange) method directly for the pre 4.5 behavior of `editable.insertElement()`.\n* [#12870](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/12870): Use [`editor.showNotification()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#method-showNotification) instead of `alert()` directly whenever possible.

Note: The previous implementation allowed passing multiple classes to `addClass()` although it was only a side effect of that implementation.

Please note that once edited in CKEditor 4.4+, all existing images of the `caption` class (`<figure class=\"caption\">`) will be [filtered out](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/guide/dev_advanced_content_filter.html) unless the [`config.image2_captionedClass`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.html#cfg-image2_captionedClass) option is set to `caption`. For backward compatibility (i.e. when upgrading), it is highly recommended to use this setting, which also helps prevent CSS conflicts, etc. This does not apply to new CKEditor integrations.\n* Widgets without defined buttons are no longer registered automatically to the [Advanced Content Filter](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/guide/dev_advanced_content_filter.html). Before CKEditor 4.4 widgets were registered to the ACF which was an incorrect behavior ([#11567](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/11567)). This change should not have any impact on standard scenarios, but if your button does not execute the widget command, you need to set [`allowedContent`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_feature.html#property-allowedContent) and [`requiredContent`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_feature.html#property-requiredContent) properties for it manually, because the editor will not be able to find them.\n* The [Show Borders](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/showborders) plugin was added to the Standard installation package in order to ensure that unstyled tables are still visible for the user ([#11665](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/11665)).\n* Since CKEditor 4.4 the editor instance should be passed to [`CKEDITOR.style`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR.style.html) methods to ensure full compatibility with other features (e.g. applying styles to widgets requires that). We ensured backward compatibility though, so the [`CKEDITOR.style`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR.style.html) will work even when the editor instance is not provided.\n\nNew Features:\n\n* [#11297](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/11297): Styles can now be applied to widgets. The definition of a style which can be applied to a specific widget must contain two additional properties &mdash; `type` and `widget`. Read more in the [Widget Styles](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/guide/dev_styles.html#widget-styles) section of the \"Syles Drop-down\" guide. Note that by default, widgets support only classes and no other attributes or styles. Related changes and features:\n  * Introduced the [`CKEDITOR.style.addCustomHandler()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_style.html#static-method-addCustomHandler) method for registering custom style handlers.\n  * The [`CKEDITOR.style.apply()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_style.html#method-apply) and [`CKEDITOR.style.remove()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_style.html#method-remove) methods are now called with an editor instance instead of the document so they can be reused by the [`CKEDITOR.editor.applyStyle()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#method-applyStyle) and [`CKEDITOR.editor.removeStyle()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#method-removeStyle) methods. Backward compatibility was preserved, but from CKEditor 4.4 it is highly recommended to pass an editor instead of a document to these methods.\n  * Many new methods and properties were introduced in the [Widget API](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR.plugins.widget.html) to make the handling of styles by widgets fully customizable.
