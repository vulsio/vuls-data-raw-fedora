Attempt to sync folders with following settings : \n\nsync{\n        default.rsyncssh,\n        source=\"/folder\",\n        host=\"192.168.0.2\",\n        targetdir=\"/folder\",\n        ssh = {\n                port=1022\n        },\n        rsync     = {\n                owner=true,\n                _extra={\"-g\"},\n        }\n}\n\nActual results:\n\nGroup ownership of the transferred files/directories on target is set to main group of user running lsyncd, root in case of daemon started from sysvinit\n\nExpected results:\n\nWith additional parameter in _extra rsync should be preserving group ownership too. \n\n\nAdditional info:\nLsyncd version 2.1.4 has a bug causing it to ignore  setting to rsync if you specify custom ssh port in the same sync object, among others. This prevents user from having group ownership synced to target location, which right now can be only passed via \"_extra\" parameter.There is stable version 2.1.5 that seems to be fixing this behaviour (https://github.com/axkibe/lsyncd/blob/master/ChangeLog).\n\nI've build 2.1.5 RPM and seems to be working as expected."
