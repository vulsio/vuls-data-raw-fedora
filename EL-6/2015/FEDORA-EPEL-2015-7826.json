Sites are [urged to upgrade immediately](https://www.drupal.org/node/1494290) after reading the notes below and the security announcement:\n\n[Drupal Core - Critical - Multiple Vulnerabilities - SA-CORE-2015-003](https://www.drupal.org/SA-CORE-2015-003)\nNo other fixes are included.\n\nNo changes have been made to the .htaccess, robots.txt or default settings.php files in this release, so upgrading custom versions of those files is not necessary.\n\n#### Known issues:\n\nNone.\n\n#### Major changes since 6.36:\n\n* For security reasons, the autocomplete system now makes Ajax requests to non-clean URLs only, although protection is also in place for custom code that does so using clean URLs. There is a new form API #process function on autocomplete-enabled text fields that is required for the autocomplete functionality to work; custom and contributed modules should ensure that they are not overriding this #process function accidentally when altering text fields on forms. Part of the security fix also includes changes to theme_textfield(); it is recommended that sites which override this theme function make those changes as well (see the theme_textfield section of this diff for details).\n* When form API token validation fails (for example, when a cross-site request forgery attempt is detected, or a user tries to submit a form after having logged out and back in again in the meantime), the form API now skips calling form element value callbacks, except for a select list of callbacks provided by Drupal core that are known to be safe. In rare cases, this could lead to data loss when a user submits a form and receives a token validation error, but the overall effect is expected to be minor.",
