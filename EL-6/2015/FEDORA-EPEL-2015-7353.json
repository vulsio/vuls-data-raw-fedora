This is a security release for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.\r\n\r\nThis release addresses six issues, including three cross-site scripting vulnerabilities and a potential SQL injection that could be used to compromise a site, which were discovered by Marc-Alexandre Montpas of Sucuri, Helen Hou-Sandí of the WordPress security team, Netanel Rubin of Check Point, and Ivan Grigorov. It also includes a fix for a potential timing side-channel attack, discovered by Johannes Schmitt of Scrutinizer, and prevents an attacker from locking a post from being edited, discovered by Mohamed A. Baset.\r\n\r\nOur thanks to those who have practiced responsible disclosure of security issues.\r\n\r\nWordPress 4.2.4 also fixes four bugs.

This is a security release for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.\r\n\r\nWordPress versions 4.2.2 and earlier are affected by a cross-site scripting vulnerability, which could allow users with the Contributor or Author role to compromise a site. This was initially reported by Jon Cave and fixed by Robert Chapin, both of the WordPress security team, and later reported by Jouko Pynnönen.\r\n\r\nWe also fixed an issue where it was possible for a user with Subscriber permissions to create a draft through Quick Draft. Reported by Netanel Rubin from Check Point Software Technologies.\r\n\r\nOur thanks to those who have practiced responsible disclosure of security issues.\r\n\r\nWordPress 4.2.3 also contains fixes for 20 bugs from 4.2.
