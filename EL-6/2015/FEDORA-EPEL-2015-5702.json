								"thetext": "Upstream released a TORQUE security advisory [1] that indicated that a non-privileged user who was able to run jobs or login to a node which ran pbs_server or pbs_mom, could submit arbitrary jobs to a pbs_mom daemon to queue and run the job, which would run as root.  All versions of TORQUE are affected.\n\nThe advisory also notes the following mitigating factors:\n\n- The user must be logged in on a node that is already legitimately able to\ncontact pbs_mom daemons or submit jobs.\n\n- If a user submits a job via this defect and pbs_server is running,\npbs_server will kill the job unless job syncing is disabled. It may take up\nto 45 seconds for pbs_server to kill the job.\n\nA patch for 2.5 is available [2], as well as 4.x [3].  Fedora ships with TORQUE 3.x, so will need to backport (or forwardport) one of these patches.\n\n\n[1] http://www.supercluster.org/pipermail/torqueusers/2013-September/016098.html\n[2] http://www.adaptivecomputing.com/torquepatch/fix_mom_priv_2.5.patch\n[3] http://www.adaptivecomputing.com/torquepatch/fix_mom_priv.patch\n\n\nA CVE request has been made:\n\nhttp://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/09/09/4"

As a result a specially crafted request can smuggle through a count value which is later decremented and becomes the ct value in a memcpy() made from within tcp_gets():\n\nmemcpy((char *)str, tp->tdis_leadp, ct);\n\nThis failure to validate count allows control over the size of the memcpy() to be leveraged and as a result control over the amount of data read from the remainder of the packet. If this value is large the memcpy() will overwrite the stack and so can be leveraged in order to gain control over the execution of the program.\nMore details can be found at [1] and [2]\n\nReferences:\n  [1]: http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/532110\n  [2]: https://labs.mwrinfosecurity.com/system/assets/662/original/torque-buffer-overflow_2014-05-14.pdf"
