								"thetext": "\nThe Ruby on Rails project reports:\n\nVulnerability in JSON Parser in Ruby on Rails 3.0 and 2.3\n\nThere is a vulnerability in the JSON  code for Ruby on Rails which allows \nattackers to bypass authentication systems, inject arbitrary SQL, inject and \nexecute arbitrary code, or perform a DoS attack on a Rails application. This \nvulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2013-0333.\n\nVersions Affected:  2.3.x, 3.0.x\nNot Affected:       3.1.x, 3.2.x\nFixed Versions:     3.0.20, 2.3.16\n\nImpact\n------\nThe JSON Parsing code in Rails 2.3 and 3.0 support multiple parsing backends. \nOne of the backends involves transforming the JSON into YAML, and passing that \nthrough the YAML parser.  Using a specially crafted payload attackers can trick\nthe backend into decoding a subset of YAML.\n\nNote: This is a seperate vulnerability to CVE-2013-0156, if you are running a \n2.3 or 3.0 application you must still take action to protect your application.\n\nReleases\n--------\nThe 3.0.20 and 2.3.16 releases are available at the normal locations.\n\nWorkarounds\n-----------\nTo work around this vulnerability you need to switch backends to the JsonGem \nbackend.  Place this code in an application initializer:\n\n  ActiveSupport::JSON.backend = \"JSONGem\"\n\nIf you are running Ruby 1.8 you will need to ensure that the json or json_pure \ngems are installed and in your application's Gemfile.  Ruby 1.9 includes this \ncode already.\n\nPatches\n-------\nTo aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches \nfor the two supported release series.  They are in git-am format and consist \nof a single changeset.\n\n* 2-3-json-parser.patch - Patch for 2.3 series\n* 3-0-json-parser.patch - Patch for 3.0 series\n\nPlease note that only the 2.3.x, 3.1.x and 3.2.x series are supported at \npresent.  Users of earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade as soon \nas possible as we cannot guarantee the continued availability of security \nfixes for unsupported releases.\n\nCredits\n-------\n\nThanks to Lawrence Pit of Mirror42 for discovering the vulnerability and \nworking responsibly with us to ensure we shipped a fix."
