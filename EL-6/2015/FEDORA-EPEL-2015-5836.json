The function iterates over the input string buffer until it finds end of headers (delimited using \\n\\n or \\r\\n\\r\\n, or until \\0 if found to indicate end of string).  Before the fix, the function did not get the length of the buffer, or pointer to its end, so it could not detect end of buffer and prevent read past the end of buffer.\n\nIn httpd 2.4.10, the buffer passed to the handle_headers() can either be stack or heap based.  Only stack based buffer is used in earlier versions.\n\nThis issue can be triggered by a malicious FastCGI server that httpd is configured to connect to.  It may also be triggered if non-malicious FastCGI server is made to generate a response with unexpectedly large headers.\n\nConsidering that over read stops when the first \\0 byte is encountered, this seems unlikely to lead to easily reproducible crash.  Additionally, crash would be limited to a specific httpd child process handling the request."
