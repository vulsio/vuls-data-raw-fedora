	"notes": "The Asterisk Development Team has announced security releases for Asterisk 1.6.2,\r\n1.8, and 10. The available security releases are released as versions 1.6.2.24,\r\n1.8.11.1, and 10.3.1.\r\n\r\nThese releases are available for immediate download at\r\nhttp://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/releases\r\n\r\nThe release of Asterisk 1.6.2.24, 1.8.11.1, and 10.3.1 resolve the following two\r\nissues:\r\n\r\n * A permission escalation vulnerability in Asterisk Manager Interface.  This\r\n  would potentially allow remote authenticated users the ability to execute\r\n  commands on the system shell with the privileges of the user running the\r\n  Asterisk application.\r\n\r\n * A heap overflow vulnerability in the Skinny Channel driver.  The keypad\r\n  button message event failed to check the length of a fixed length buffer\r\n  before appending a received digit to the end of that buffer.  A remote\r\n  authenticated user could send sufficient keypad button message events that the\r\n  buffer would be overrun.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the release of Asterisk 1.8.11.1 and 10.3.1 resolve the following\r\nissue:\r\n\r\n * A remote crash vulnerability in the SIP channel driver when processing UPDATE\r\n  requests.  If a SIP UPDATE request was received indicating a connected line\r\n  update after a channel was terminated but before the final destruction of the\r\n  associated SIP dialog, Asterisk would attempt a connected line update on a\r\n  non-existing channel, causing a crash.\r\n\r\nThese issues and their resolution are described in the security advisories.\r\n\r\nFor more information about the details of these vulnerabilities, please read\r\nsecurity advisories AST-2012-004, AST-2012-005, and AST-2012-006, which were\r\nreleased at the same time as this announcement.\r\n\r\nFor a full list of changes in the current releases, please see the ChangeLogs:\r\n\r\nhttp://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/releases/ChangeLog-1.6.2.24\r\nhttp://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/releases/ChangeLog-1.8.11.1\r\nhttp://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/releases/ChangeLog-10.3.1\r\n\r\nThe security advisories are available at:\r\n\r\n * http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/security/AST-2012-004.pdf\r\n * http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/security/AST-2012-005.pdf\r\n * http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/security/AST-2012-006.pdf\r\n\nUpdate to 1.8.11.0\nUpdate to 1.8.10.1, which fixes 2 security vulnerabilities.",
