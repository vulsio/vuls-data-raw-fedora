A thousand apologies.)\n\nPackage Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you\nplan to fix it in a currently maintained version, feel free to reopen\nthis bug and simply change the 'version' to a later Fedora version.\n\nBug Reporter: Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that\nwe were unable to fix it before Fedora 15 reached end of life. If you\nwould still like to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it\nagainst a later version of Fedora, you are encouraged to click on\n\"Clone This Bug\" (top right of this page) and open it against that\nversion of Fedora.\n\nAlthough we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's\nlifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a\nmore recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes\nbugs or makes them obsolete.\n\nThe process we are following is described here:\nhttp://fedoraproject.org/wiki/BugZappers/HouseKeeping"
