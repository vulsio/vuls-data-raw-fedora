I'm on a big network, and DHCP requests are pretty slow (more than 1 second). That is more than the time for fedora to start Network-Manager and puppet (even if the first is S27 and the second is S98).\n\nWhen started with neither DNS server nor puppet-master reachable, puppetd won't be able to reach it later. Every 2 minutes, I get :\n\nOct 30 15:59:50 b01-10 puppetd[1708]: Reopening log files\nOct 30 15:59:50 b01-10 puppetd[1708]: Could not find server : getaddrinfo: Temporary failure in name resolution\nOct 30 15:59:50 b01-10 puppetd[1708]: Could not request certificate: Certificate retrieval failed: Could not find server puppet\n\nthis is ok since a few lines after :\n\nOct 30 15:59:53 b01-10 dhclient: DHCPREQUEST on eth0 to 255.255.255.255 port 67\nOct 30 15:59:53 b01-10 dhclient: DHCPNAK from 10.X.Y.1\nOct 30 15:59:53 b01-10 NetworkManager: <info>  DHCP: device eth0 state changed preinit -> expire\nOct 30 15:59:53 b01-10 NetworkManager: <info>  DHCP: device eth0 state changed expire -> preinit\nOct 30 15:59:53 b01-10 dhclient: DHCPDISCOVER on eth0 to 255.255.255.255 port 67 interval 4\nOct 30 15:59:53 b01-10 dhclient: DHCPOFFER from 10.X.Y.8\nOct 30 15:59:53 b01-10 dhclient: DHCPREQUEST on eth0 to 255.255.255.255 port 67\nOct 30 15:59:53 b01-10 dhclient: DHCPACK from 10.X.Y.8\n...\n\nHere's network is fully working\nBut 2 minutes later :\n\nOct 30 16:01:50 b01-10 puppetd[1708]: Could not find server : getaddrinfo: Temporary failure in name resolution\nOct 30 16:01:50 b01-10 puppetd[1708]: Could not request certificate: Certificate retrieval failed: Could not find server puppet\n\n(I checked: my DNS are ok, I can ping puppet, and other puppet clients can reach it)\n\nIf I restart puppetd AFTER getting an IP and DNS conf, puppet is working again :\n\nOct 30 15:11:21 b01-10 puppetd[3077]: Starting Puppet client version 0.24.8\n\nand no more error every 2 mins, polling master every 30 min\n\nVersion-Release number of selected component (if applicable):\nName       : puppet\nArch       : noarch\nVersion    : 0.24.8\nRelease    : 4.fc11\n\nName       : NetworkManager\nArch       : i586\nEpoch      : 1\nVersion    : 0.7.1\nRelease    : 8.git20090708.fc11\n\n\nHow reproducible:\nalways\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. install puppet client on network-manager managed machines (for IP and DNS/resolv.conf writing)\n  \nActual results:\npuppet can't get their catalog\n\nExpected results:\npuppet client to reach puppet-master\n\nAdditional info:\nyou can start puppetd by hand, it will work : at reboot, you'll have to do it again"
