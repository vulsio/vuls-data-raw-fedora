Fields like 'password', 'identity', 'private_key', 'private_key_passwd' etc., were not excluded from being logged into /var/log/wicd log file, which could allow local attacker, with the privileges of the 'adm' group to view content of these entities in plain text, leading to information disclosure.  This update fixes the problem.\r\n\r\nA reboot is not technically necessary, but if you do not reboot your system after installing this update, you should at least restart the wicd service.",
