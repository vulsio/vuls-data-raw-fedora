This is why EL-5 is still at 0.1.1 in EL-5, though I've not investigated if that might be updated now with the php53 stack.\n\nRegarding EL-6 and 0.5.x -> 0.7.x, it does require a database update, but I think that's the only disruptive change.  \n\nChristoph, if you or Jeroen would like to research and/or tackle either or both of those you have my blessing.  I've been a bit out of the loop on rcm since I shut down my instance, which was when I changed email addresses incidentally. :)"
