For example, I see it when creating a network:\n\n    $ sudo nova-manage network create admin 10.0.0.0/24 1 256 --bridge=br0\n\nThe error comes from Service.report_state() in nova/service.py.  This function gets called in a loop in a background thread.  By default, it runs every 10 seconds.  This error occurs when this check happens in the middle of some operation being processed.  In my last test of creating a network, it took almost 20 seconds to complete and I got the error once in the middle.\n\nI'd consider this a fairly low priority issue to deal with, because:\n\na) After reviewing the code it's coming from, it appears to be more of an annoyance than a real problem.\n\nb) It's probably specific to sqlite.  If you switch to a different db backend, I bet it doesn't happen.\n\n\nWe could fix it, but there are probably some other things we would want to focus on first.  The report_state() code could be made a bit smarter on what it considers an error.  Or perhaps it makes more sense to do something to synchronize access to the sqlite db.\n\nIf it's bothersome enough, we could consider switching to a different backend DB by default."
