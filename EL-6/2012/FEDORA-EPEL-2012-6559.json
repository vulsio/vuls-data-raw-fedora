It is trivially possible to craft a\nreasonably-sized file which, when decompressed in this fashion, grows\nto enormous size, consuming available memory and offering the ability\nto perform a denial-of-service attack.\n\nTo mitigate this, image validation will now make use of PIL's\nImage.verify() method, which performs some validation checks but does\nnot decompress or read the entire image file.\n\nReferences:\n\nhttps://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2012/jul/30/security-releases-issued/"
