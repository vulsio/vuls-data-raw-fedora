This update will not be pushed to F-14 or F-15 as is; the EL-6 update is fine wrt. this because it does not add the dependency.  \n\nAnother thing I didn't realize was that the dependency is truly optional - things will still work to some extent without timidity.cfg and related patches installed, but will just sound much poorer and a warning will be emitted, but that's good enough considering how marginal the use cases for playing back ABC and MIDI files through libmodplug are.  Besides, before 0.8.8.3 any attempt to play back ABC or MIDI files through libmodplug with timidity.cfg from fluid-soundfont-lite-patches installed resulted in a crash due to faults in libmodplug's timidify.cfg parsing.\n\nUpstream has notified me that another libmodplug update is imminent - I'm discussing and trying to figure out when exactly will it be released, and whether it contains changes important to us.  If I don't hear back in a day or two I'll just push another 0.8.8.3 update with the dependency on timidity.cfg removed."

I don't know if there's a lighter weight package containing those patches in Fedora or interest in adding one, but this most certainly is not the best place to discuss it :)"
