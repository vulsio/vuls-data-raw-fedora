If you \nwould still like to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it \nagainst a later version of Fedora please change the 'version' of this \nbug to the applicable version.  If you are unable to change the version, \nplease add a comment here and someone will do it for you.\n\nAlthough we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's \nlifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events.
