						"thetext": "Milan, I've spent time this night to try to get the whole picture and as you\ndid not answer to my e-mail, here some details how I think, we should go on:\nhttp://robert.fedorapeople.org/pub/clamav-rework/ contains a source RPM, that\nis based on -1.1, but broken down to 4 binary clamav RPM packages. I'm pretty\nsure, that package is currently only busted, but it's a first try.\n\nI think, our goal should be to make EPEL clamav very closed to RPMForge/DAG\none, but still to provide the flexibility using clamd.<SERVICE> optional for\nusers wanting or needing it (e.g. clamd.amavisd or individual stuff).\n\nI would like to provide a usable clamd package with a usable clamd server, as\nRPMForge/DAG currently does. That one can per default be used by clamav-milter\npackage (dependency set already should fit). Next I want to see freshclam as\na part of the main clamav package and easy to enable (means: one single point\nto enable, the /etc/cron.d/freshclam file or similar). What we need to keep is\nthe clamd-wrapper for e.g. clamd.<SERVICE>. Next we have to provide usable\ndefault configuration files, the RPMForge/DAG ones seem to be nice, but needs\nto be checked as well.\n\nThe fedora-usermgmt stuff is nice, but I want to conditionalize as I already\ndid in mimedefang package in Fedora. This is what a couple of users expects,\nwhen they're writing me e-mails.\n\nImportant for freshclam is, that I don't want to ship 20 MB of outdated data\nfor clamav! I often had the case, that a clamav-update with clamav-data even\nbroke my clamav daemons, because my database files have been already newer, so\nthe downgrade broke it. The end user anyway initially (!) has to load the 20\nMB databases for clamav - it doesn't matter whether he fetches via freshclam \nand is already up-to-date or whether the 20 MB are downloaded all the time. \nAnd switching over from -data to -data-empty breaks also stuff which caused me\nto re-download the 20 MB afterwards again on all my managed mail servers. So\nI don't want to ship the database, just empty files that can be filled by the\nfreshclam we ship but make easily to enable at a single place.\n\nNevertheless I want to keep the upgrade path of EPEL as far as possible (the\nupstream milter rework will cause pain anyway). Of course it will cause some\npain, but lets try to minimize it.\n\nNote, that I'm neither the Fedora clamav maintainer nor EPEL clamav maintainer\nnor any co-maintainer of clamav in Fedora. I'm just the guy using clamav from\nEPEL at my employer (without clamav-milter) and driving the version bumps at\nEPEL and Fedora (Steve didn't touch the package for a very long time, I'm the\nonly guy touching clamav package since > 1 year in EPEL and I'm touching it in\nFedora Rawhide or other Fedora branches sometimes, if Enrico seems to be AWOL\nonce more). I'm willing to spend time to clamav, if you are going to help me\nto get clamav on EPEL really usable (and maybe better than RPMForge/DAG)... ;)\n\nI did not yet (!) include your work from comment #42/#45/#46/#47 at all, I was\njust focussed to get packages down and the dependency set working. I had some\nlooks to your patch, the idea looks well, but it maybe still needs some love.\nWilling to walk and drive the same road as suggested above?"

Before installing your packages from http://ftp.pslib.cz/pub/local/rpm/RHEL-4/ I removed the old clamav / clamav-milter installation, so I was able to start from scratch.\n\nI installed clamav-milter, and the relative dependencies (clamav-data and clamav).\nNo more fedora-usrmgmt* dependendecies, and this is a good thing! ;-)\nI looked at the config files and they looked already tuned for my needs (in the past I *ALWAYS* had to adjust a couple of parameters per config file), and this is also a good thing.\n\nThen I started the clamav-milter service with the usual:\n\n/etc/init.d/clamav-milter start\n\nand it gave me the error:\n\nStarting clamav-milter: : Usage: daemon [+/-nicelevel]{program}\n\nSomeone have an idea about what's causing this issue?\n\nThanks to all.\nSimo"

I can't get clamav to work correctly.\n\nHaving poked around some, it would seem that in addition to the issues discussed above, there are also permission issues involved. Between the various ID's used for clam and sendmail, plus selinux targeted enforcement, it's rather difficult to get this working.\n\nWhile using the local socket is efficient, I'm thinking that absent working this all out it might be reasonable to move to a TCP socket for now.\n\nI was able to get past the clamav-milter talking to clamd, but then sendmail wouldn't talk to clamav-milter. Fixed all the permissions on the socket, but hit SELinux denials.\n\nFwiw, I downloaded the latest source from clamav.net and hit the same issues on Fedora 11. I was not enforcing selinux on 10... might drop that on 11 for now."

That means that upgrading to 0.96 is critically important.\n\nMike, as the reporter, please change the Priority/Severity of this bug to high/high. Thanks."
