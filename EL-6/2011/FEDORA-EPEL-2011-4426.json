If an admin is logged into the Cherokee admin interface and visits a site which runs a malicious script, Cherokee can be reconfigured to execute arbitrary commands [1].  It is also vulnerable to use the CSRF to produce a persistant XSS [2].\n\nThe second (CVE-2011-2090) is that Cherokee seeds srand with a combination of the time and the PID of the admin process, after which rand() is called to generate a random password -- this is unsafe and allows for fairly easy local password guessing by a local user [3].\n\n[1] http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2011/Jun/0\n[2] http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/06/03/6\n[3] http://code.google.com/p/cherokee/issues/detail?id=1212"

Is this a new bug or should it be considered part of this or is there some other bug opened on this (I can't find one)?\n\nMore details: \nI don't know if it was broken in F15 because, although I had installed vsftp in F15, I had not tried starting/stopping it via system-config-vsftpd. I don't really remember but I think I started it through system-config-services.\n\nWhen I try to start the server via system-config-vsftpd, it fails with the following message in the Status Log: \"sh: /etc/init.d/vsftpd: No such file or directory\"\n\nThe server will start via command line: /bin/systemctl start vsftpd.service\n\nWhen started via the above command line, the fact that it is started is not recognized by system-config-vsftpd and thus cannot be stopped by system-config-vsftpd. Xfer Log and System Log do contain information related to vsftp activity performed using the server started by the command line.\n\nThanks\nJim"

( which one would be doing in an functional community which Fedora is not )\n\nThose up to 300 hours you could be spending for nothing since the maintainers of those 150 components ( assuming they exist in the first place ) would by now, if interested done the migration themselves so the likely hood is that they a) they dont exist or b) opposed the migration or simply dont know what they are doing thus wont accept those patches is higher than you think so you would be wasted that time for nothing.\n\nIn a larger scheme of things those 300 hours of your contributed time with your skill sett is better spent a) directly upstream systemd or b) properly prep and fix python 3.x integration in Fedora ( that is if Toshio and Red Hat's SCL let by Marcela has not royally thwarted that effort for the distribution ) and finally c) simply with your family.\n\nLet this and other integration/migration work be handled by Red Hat employees since they are incapable of accepting responsibility for the outcome of the decisions they make and the position they are in.\n\nThe only way they will learn is having them to do all the hard work themselves since they are incapable of listening as in by bumping into those things them themselves."
