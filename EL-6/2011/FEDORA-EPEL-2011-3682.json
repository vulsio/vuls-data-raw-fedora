						"thetext": "Description of problem:\n\nI cannot upload images to the directory \n\n/usr/share/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/ \n\nusing the Fedora version of Wordpress, with its own upload screens and code. This is true even if I am a Wordpress user who has been assigned the \"author\" role by the blog's admin person. For example, logging in as user 'bob' who has 'author' privileges and clicking the link to create a new post, and then clicking the icon for uploading an image, and then browsing to the local file \"myphoto.jpg\", and then clicking the \"upload\" button will result in an error message in red text stating (the very first time you attempt the first upload in a brand new Wordpress installation) that the directory /usr/share/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/[year]/[month] cannot be created. If you create these two directories e.g. \n\n/usr/share/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/09\n\nyou will then get a new error message stating that the file cannot be moved to /usr/share/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/09.\n   \nThis is true whether you use the \"flash upload\" feature of Wordpress or the \"browser upload\" feature. \n\nThe failure also occurs if you create your own php script for uploading files to this directory, say a script named testuploads.php, move this to the web server's document root /var/www/html, and then try to upload as the apache user. \n\nIf you explore php's upload features a bit and set the 'upload_tmp_dir' directive of /etc/php.ini to some value in /tmp, say /tmp/php_uploads, you start to get a clue to the real source of the problem: when php attempts to upload to the temp directory, you get SELinux AVC denials when running in SELinux enforcing mode.\n   \n\nVersion-Release number of selected component (if applicable):\n\n\nwordpress-2.8.3-2.fc11.noarch\n\n(This problem very likely affects the rawhide version too, built for Fedora 12) \n\n\nHow reproducible:\n\nEvery time you attempt an upload through Wordpress to /usr/share/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\n1. See above problem description\n\n  \nActual results:\n\nUpload fails with error messages indicated above.\n\nExpected results:\n\nThe apache user should have create directory, create file, read and write file access to the directory intended for Wordpress file uploads. This has to be addressed through a combination of placing the upload directory in the right location, setting file permissions correctly, and setting SELinux file contexts correctly. \n\nAdditional info:\n\nI was able to fix this with help from Dominick Grift (domg472@gmail.com) and Dan Walsh (dwalsh@redhat.com) and by browsing the SELinux documentation here: http://docs.fedoraproject.org/selinux-managing-confined-services-guide/en-US/F11/html/sect-Managing_Confined_Services-The_Apache_HTTP_Server-Types.html\n\nStep 1.\n\nchcon -R -t httpd_sys_content_rw_t /usr/share/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/\nchcon -R -t httpd_sys_content_rw_t /tmp/php_uploads \nservice httpd start \n\nTesting with chcon shows this will get uploads going, if the user apache also has group write access to the directory. The directory /tmp/php_uploads is the directory I specified in /etc/php.ini for 'upload_tmp_dir'.\n\nHere is the content of my Wordpress upload directory:\n\n[root@deafeng3 ~]# ls -al /usr/share/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/\ntotal 68\ndrwxrwxr-x. 2 apache apache  4096 2009-09-11 17:17 .\ndrwxrwxr-x. 3 apache apache  4096 2009-09-05 03:58 ..\n-rw-rw-r--. 1 apache apache  4743 2009-09-11 17:17 chigger_bites_close_up_one_foot_2009-09-02_small_v1-150x150.jpg\n-rw-rw-r--. 1 apache apache 48020 2009-09-11 17:17 chigger_bites_close_up_one_foot_2009-09-02_small_v1.jpg\n-rw-r--r--. 1 apache apache    85 2009-09-07 11:03 .htaccess\n\nNote: I created the .htaccess file based on researching the Wordpress website, but it was not helpful for this problem.\n\nStep 2.\n\nIssue all of these commands:\n\nsemanage fcontext -a -t httpd_sys_content_rw_t /tmp/php_uploads\nrestorecon -R -v /tmp/php_uploads\nsemanage fcontext -a -t httpd_sys_content_rw_t \"/usr/share/wordpress/wp-content/uploads(/.*)?\"\nrestorecon -R -v /usr/share/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/\n\nStep 3.\n\nRetry the Wordpress upload procedure by creating a test Wordpress post that includes a new image upload. It should still work.\n\nStep 4.\n\nReboot the machine and again retry the Wordpress upload procedure by creating a test Wordpress post (a third one) that includes a new image upload. It should still work.\n\nNo doubt I did some unnecessary steps above -- someone much more experienced than me can probably distill this to the bare minimum number of steps needed to achieve results.\n\nFinally, /usr doesn't seem the finest place to put the wordpress upload directory. Why not move it under /var/www/html? That is what I would do. If that happens and you make the directories writable to the apache user, the right SELinux contexts are either already there, or you can add them as part of the rpm installation procedure."
