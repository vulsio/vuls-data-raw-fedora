						"thetext": "Description of problem:\nUpstream cacti tarballs have log and rra as subdirs in main cacti directory.  They both contain .htaccess file that prevents access to files in those directories via httpd.\n\nIn Fedora cacti packages, those directories are replaced by symlinks to directories created elsewhere (in /var), but there's no restriction equivalent to .htaccess files provided by upstream.  So it is possible to download log or rra files (if you can guess their names).\n\nDefault cacti-httpd.conf only allows localhost to access cacti, but I believe this restriction is more of a safe default before cacti can be configured and expected to be removed.  It may be a good idea to extend default httpd config to clarify purpose of default localhost restriction and add additional restrictions on log and rra (and scripts possibly too) not expected to be removed after initial configuration.\n\nVersion-Release number of selected component (if applicable):\ncacti-0.8.7f-1"

						"thetext": "Jon,\n\nI took a look at that RPM. Here are my three suggestions:\n\n1. On the original subject of this bug, I don't see the /log or /rra directories denied anywhere. You should probably insert the following additional sections to /etc/httpd/conf.d/cacti.conf:\n\n<Directory /usr/share/cacti/log>\n    order deny,allow\n    Deny from all\n</Directory>\n<Directory /usr/share/cacti/rra>\n    order deny,allow\n    Deny from all\n</Directory>\n\n2. To keep with the \"localhost only, out of the box\" convention, you should probably modify my suggested configuration from \"Allow from all\" to \"allow from 127.0.0.1\" in the /include directory. It would look like this:\n\n<Directory /usr/share/cacti/include>\n    order deny,allow\n    Deny from all\n    <FilesMatch (.gif|.css|.js)$>\n        order allow,deny\n        Allow from 127.0.0.1\n    </FilesMatch>\n</Directory>\n\n3. To help out the user, it would be useful to add a note in either README.cacti or etc/httpd/conf.d/cacti.conf (my preference). Something like:\n\n# Users: Change \"Allow from 127.0.0.1\" to open up cacti to other network devices. For example, change \"Allow from 127.0.0.1\" to \"Allow from all\".\n# The sections marked \"deny from all\" should not be modified. These are in place in order to harden cacti."

Our environment is setup similar to Phil's where we install the EPEL Cacti package and run the Plugin Architecture patch script that upstream provides. Since upstream no longer provides the patch script, there's no way to include PIA anymore. Unfortunately in my case, since we use the thresholds plugin extensively for monitoring, we're left without those monitors until its patched with PIA.\n\nI would also suggest the creation of a separate package that includes PIA baked in as a stopgap until the codebases are completely merged, which looks a few months off still. Unless Phil has already had success, I can attempt to create and install a modified Cacti+PIA package using the current Cacti SPEC file as the template."
