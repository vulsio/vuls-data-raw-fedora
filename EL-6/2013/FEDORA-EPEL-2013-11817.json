In order to restore this\nrepresentation to python code while parsing the JSON, Djblets would\nuse the eval() routine to execute them, leading to a risk of executing\narbitrary code in the Review Board process.\n\n=== Affected Deployments ===\nAll Djblets deployments (and therefore all existing Review Board\ndeployments) are vulnerable to this flaw.\n\n=== Scope ===\nA remote attacker might be able to construct a JSON request containing\nmalicious python code that could be executed within the mod_wsgi\nprocess on the server. It is unknown to what extent it could cause\ndamage, but denial-of-service at the minimum.\n\n=== Resolution ===\nDjblets will now use the literal_eval() routine instead of the eval()\nroutine when run on platforms with Python 2.6 or later. The\nliteral_eval() routine will sanitize the results such that only\nassignments of literal variables is permitted, as opposed to arbitrary\npython code execution.\n\nSpecial note: If Djblets is installed on a platform running\nPython 2.5 or earlier, this code will fall back to the earlier,\nless-secure eval() routine. Djblets upstream strongly recommends\nmigrating such deployments to a more recent version of Python.\n\nIt is noted that the primary consumer of this library - Review Board - is not believed to be vulnerable to this issue, as there are other safeguards in place. However, it is possible that other unknown consumers of this library are at risk.\n\n=== Acknowledgements ===\nChristian Hammond, lead upstream developer of Review Board is credited\nwith discovering and correcting this vulnerability.\n\n=== Embargo Information ===\nUpstream has coordinated with packagers of various distributions and cloud application vendors to lift the embargo on Thursday, October 8, 2013. This BZ should become public at that time.\n\n\nUpstream has requested that Red Hat please coordinate the issuance of a CVE for this vulnerability."

In order to restore this\nrepresentation to python code while parsing the JSON, Djblets would\nuse the eval() routine to execute them, leading to a risk of executing\narbitrary code in the Review Board process.\n\n=== Affected Deployments ===\nAll Djblets deployments (and therefore all existing Review Board\ndeployments) are vulnerable to this flaw.\n\n=== Scope ===\nA remote attacker might be able to construct a JSON request containing\nmalicious python code that could be executed within the mod_wsgi\nprocess on the server. It is unknown to what extent it could cause\ndamage, but denial-of-service at the minimum.\n\n=== Resolution ===\nDjblets will now use the literal_eval() routine instead of the eval()\nroutine when run on platforms with Python 2.6 or later. The\nliteral_eval() routine will sanitize the results such that only\nassignments of literal variables is permitted, as opposed to arbitrary\npython code execution.\n\nSpecial note: If Djblets is installed on a platform running\nPython 2.5 or earlier, this code will fall back to the earlier,\nless-secure eval() routine. Djblets upstream strongly recommends\nmigrating such deployments to a more recent version of Python.\n\nIt is noted that the primary consumer of this library - Review Board - is not believed to be vulnerable to this issue, as there are other safeguards in place. However, it is possible that other unknown consumers of this library are at risk.\n\n=== Acknowledgements ===\nChristian Hammond, lead upstream developer of Review Board is credited\nwith discovering and correcting this vulnerability.\n\n=== Embargo Information ===\nUpstream has coordinated with packagers of various distributions and cloud application vendors to lift the embargo on Thursday, October 8, 2013. This BZ should become public at that time.\n\n\nUpstream has requested that Red Hat please coordinate the issuance of a CVE for this vulnerability."

It also fixes cases with invite-only groups where the group name and list of private review requests would show up on some pages (though the review requests themselves were not accessible).\r\n\r\n    These issues do not affect most of the installations out there, but we strongly recommend upgrading anyway. There are no known cases of anyone exploiting these bugs, and in fact we discovered these internally while building new tools to test for security vulnerabilities in our codebase.\r\n\r\n    There are also some other bug fixes, and important changes needed for extensions that provide their own REST APIs.",
