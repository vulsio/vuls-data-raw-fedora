Reported by mala and Szymon Gruszecki. (Developers: More on SWFUpload here.)\r\n- Prevention of a denial of service attack, affecting sites using password-protected posts.\r\n- An update to an external TinyMCE library to fix a cross-site scripting vulnerability. Reported by Wan Ikram.\r\n- Multiple fixes for cross-site scripting. Reported by Andrea Santese and Rodrigo.\r\n- Avoid disclosing a full file path when a upload fails.
