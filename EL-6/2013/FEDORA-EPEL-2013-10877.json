						"thetext": "Description of problem:\n\nDue to a past naming conflict, the python-pip package only provides a \"pip-python\" command, rather than the upstream \"pip\" command.\n\nThis leads many Python users to believe that Fedora's pip package is broken, as standard upstream instructions fail with an unhelpful error message.\n\nHow reproducible:\nAlways\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Install python-pip\n2. Run \"pip install --user requests\" (for example)\n  \nActual results:\n\n  $ pip install --user requests\n  bash: pip: command not found\n\nExpected results:\n  $pip install --user requests\n  Requirement already satisfied (use --upgrade to upgrade): requests in /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages\n  Cleaning up...\n\nAdditional info:\n\nWhereas the previously conflicting Perl package was originally only added as a dependency of padre (which has since removed the dependency), Python's pip is the installation tool recommended by the CPython core development team. An official packaging user guide is being developed (see https://bitbucket.org/pypa/python-packaging-user-guide) which will explicitly recommend the use of pip.\n\nIn Python 3.4, it is likely that the standard library will provide the pip binary itself, with the implementation machinery bootstrapped into the user's home directory if it isn't pre-installed as part of the operating system packages (see PEP 439: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0439/).\n\nI believe the central place pip occupies amongst the Python community (in contrast to the niche role of the Perl tool) is sufficient reason to reconsider the previous decision, and change the python-pip package to start installing /usr/bin/pip. At present, this issue means that Fedora offers an inferior \"out of the box\" experience for Python developers compared to Debian (who dropped the Perl package in favour of the Python one when the conflict was first noted)."
