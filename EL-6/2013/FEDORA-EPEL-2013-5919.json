If someone considers this to be problem, please speak up :)\n\nThis change should only affect images that are built with the fedora-live-base.ks kickstart included, so if the 'appliance' images where this behaviour is not desired are not based off that kickstart, things should be fine. If they *are* based off that kickstart, we may need to split things out some more."
