Multiple core and contributed modules are affected by this issue.\n\njQuery versions 1.6.3 and higher provide protection against common forms of this problem; thus, the vulnerability is mitigated if your site has upgraded to a recent version of jQuery. However, the versions of jQuery that are shipped with Drupal 6 and Drupal 7 core do not contain this protection.\n\nAlthough the fix added to Drupal as part of this security release prevents the most common forms of this issue in the same way as newer versions of jQuery do, developers should be aware that passing untrusted user input directly to jQuery functions such as jQuery() and $() is unsafe and should be avoided.\n\n* Access bypass (Book module printer friendly version - Drupal 6 and 7):\n========================================================================\n\nA vulnerability was identified that exposes the title or, in some cases, the content of nodes that the user should not have access to.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the bypass is only accessible to users who already have the 'access printer-friendly version' permission (which is not granted to Anonymous or Authenticated users by default) and it only affects nodes that are part of a book outline.\n\n* Access bypass (Image module - Drupal 7):\n==========================================\n\nDrupal core provides the ability to have private files, including images. A vulnerability was identified in which derivative images (which Drupal automatically creates from these images based on \"image styles\" and which may differ, for example, in size or saturation) did not always receive the same protection. Under some circumstances, this would allow users to access image derivatives for images they should not be able to view.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that it only affects sites which use the Image module and which store images in a private file system.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nReferences:\n[1] http://drupal.org/SA-CORE-2013-001\n[2] http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=698333\n[3] http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=698334"

Multiple core and contributed modules are affected by this issue.\n\njQuery versions 1.6.3 and higher provide protection against common forms of this problem; thus, the vulnerability is mitigated if your site has upgraded to a recent version of jQuery. However, the versions of jQuery that are shipped with Drupal 6 and Drupal 7 core do not contain this protection.\n\nAlthough the fix added to Drupal as part of this security release prevents the most common forms of this issue in the same way as newer versions of jQuery do, developers should be aware that passing untrusted user input directly to jQuery functions such as jQuery() and $() is unsafe and should be avoided.\n\n* Access bypass (Book module printer friendly version - Drupal 6 and 7):\n========================================================================\n\nA vulnerability was identified that exposes the title or, in some cases, the content of nodes that the user should not have access to.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the bypass is only accessible to users who already have the 'access printer-friendly version' permission (which is not granted to Anonymous or Authenticated users by default) and it only affects nodes that are part of a book outline.\n\n* Access bypass (Image module - Drupal 7):\n==========================================\n\nDrupal core provides the ability to have private files, including images. A vulnerability was identified in which derivative images (which Drupal automatically creates from these images based on \"image styles\" and which may differ, for example, in size or saturation) did not always receive the same protection. Under some circumstances, this would allow users to access image derivatives for images they should not be able to view.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that it only affects sites which use the Image module and which store images in a private file system.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nReferences:\n[1] http://drupal.org/SA-CORE-2013-001\n[2] http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=698333\n[3] http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=698334"

Multiple core and contributed modules are affected by this issue.\n\njQuery versions 1.6.3 and higher provide protection against common forms of this problem; thus, the vulnerability is mitigated if your site has upgraded to a recent version of jQuery. However, the versions of jQuery that are shipped with Drupal 6 and Drupal 7 core do not contain this protection.\n\nAlthough the fix added to Drupal as part of this security release prevents the most common forms of this issue in the same way as newer versions of jQuery do, developers should be aware that passing untrusted user input directly to jQuery functions such as jQuery() and $() is unsafe and should be avoided.\n\n* Access bypass (Book module printer friendly version - Drupal 6 and 7):\n========================================================================\n\nA vulnerability was identified that exposes the title or, in some cases, the content of nodes that the user should not have access to.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the bypass is only accessible to users who already have the 'access printer-friendly version' permission (which is not granted to Anonymous or Authenticated users by default) and it only affects nodes that are part of a book outline.\n\n* Access bypass (Image module - Drupal 7):\n==========================================\n\nDrupal core provides the ability to have private files, including images. A vulnerability was identified in which derivative images (which Drupal automatically creates from these images based on \"image styles\" and which may differ, for example, in size or saturation) did not always receive the same protection. Under some circumstances, this would allow users to access image derivatives for images they should not be able to view.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that it only affects sites which use the Image module and which store images in a private file system.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nReferences:\n[1] http://drupal.org/SA-CORE-2013-001\n[2] http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=698333\n[3] http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=698334"

Multiple core and contributed modules are affected by this issue.\n\njQuery versions 1.6.3 and higher provide protection against common forms of this problem; thus, the vulnerability is mitigated if your site has upgraded to a recent version of jQuery. However, the versions of jQuery that are shipped with Drupal 6 and Drupal 7 core do not contain this protection.\n\nAlthough the fix added to Drupal as part of this security release prevents the most common forms of this issue in the same way as newer versions of jQuery do, developers should be aware that passing untrusted user input directly to jQuery functions such as jQuery() and $() is unsafe and should be avoided.\n\n* Access bypass (Book module printer friendly version - Drupal 6 and 7):\n========================================================================\n\nA vulnerability was identified that exposes the title or, in some cases, the content of nodes that the user should not have access to.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the bypass is only accessible to users who already have the 'access printer-friendly version' permission (which is not granted to Anonymous or Authenticated users by default) and it only affects nodes that are part of a book outline.\n\n* Access bypass (Image module - Drupal 7):\n==========================================\n\nDrupal core provides the ability to have private files, including images. A vulnerability was identified in which derivative images (which Drupal automatically creates from these images based on \"image styles\" and which may differ, for example, in size or saturation) did not always receive the same protection. Under some circumstances, this would allow users to access image derivatives for images they should not be able to view.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that it only affects sites which use the Image module and which store images in a private file system.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nReferences:\n[1] http://drupal.org/SA-CORE-2013-001\n[2] http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=698333\n[3] http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=698334"
