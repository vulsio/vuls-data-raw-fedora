YUI 2.5.0 through 2.9.0 allows remote\nattackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the allowedDomain\nparameter.\n\n\nUpstream indicates that all YUI2 files should be removed and that YUI3, which is not vulnerable to this issue, should be used instead.\n\nThe dojo package contains an uploader.swf, and grepping in the source there is a reference to YUI in the LICENSES file, but there is no changelog and no way that I can tell to determine the version of uploader.swf and whether it is from YUI or not (I suspect it is but am not certain).  Filing tracking bugs for the dojo maintainer to look into this.  Newer versions of moodle as found in EPEL6 and Fedora 19 ship with components from YUI 3.x; but older moodle as provided by EPEL5 and Fedora 18 do ship the vulnerable YUI2-based uploader.swf."

Filing tracking bugs for the dojo maintainer to look into this.  Newer versions of moodle as found in EPEL6 and Fedora 19 ship with components from YUI 3.x; but older moodle as provided by EPEL5 and Fedora 18 do ship the vulnerable YUI2-based uploader.swf."
