The prime testing code has a bug and will test t times the same prime from ltm_prime_tab, resulting in potentially weaker prime testing.\n\nThe offset in ltm_prime_tab is supposed to be x (the incrementing value in the for loop), rather than t, which does not change.\n\n144       /* is this prime? */\n145       for (x = 0; x < t; x++) {\n146           mp_set(&b, ltm_prime_tab[t]);\n147           if ((err = mp_prime_miller_rabin(a, &b, &res)) != MP_OKAY) {\n148              goto LBL_ERR;\n149           }\n150           if (res == MP_NO) {\n151              break;\n152           }\n153       }\n\n\nlibtommath is also embedded in dropbear, which is an ssh server/client, and as a result may affect the integrity of generated keys (I don't know this for sure, but a comment in the Gentoo bz [2] implies this may be a problem, as upstream is considering the possibility).\n\nSimilar code exists in silc-toolkit's lib/silcmath/tma.c, but it properly uses x (silc-toolkit-1.0.2/lib/silcmath/tma.c):\n\n5602       for (x = PRIME_SIZE - 2; x >= 0; x--) {\n5603           if (mp_cmp_d(a, ltm_prime_tab[x]) != MP_LT) {\n\n\nClamav has similar code as well in libclamav/bignum.c but is similar to that in silc-toolkit (looks identical).\n\nThe fix is to change \"ltm_prime_tab[t]\" to \"ltm_prime_tab[x]\".\n\nI also believe that having libtommath embedded in dropbear would be against our policies, so we should try to make dropbear use the system libtommath.  dropbear is not compiled static, so we should be able to make it use the system libtommath rather than its own internal copy.\n\n[1] http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=328383\n[2] http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=328409#c2"
