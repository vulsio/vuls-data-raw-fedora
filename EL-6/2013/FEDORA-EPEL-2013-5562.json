Then it would be possible for someone interested to create a python26-pip package if they wished.  That would mean that installing modules via pip would only be possible for the python26 interpreter, not the python-2.4 that ships with RHEL5.  But for a lot of developers, that might not be so bad.  If someone really wants pip as an rpm for python-2.4 they'd need to either port the current pip to python-2.4 or backport this security fix, backport pip's change to use pypi's https url and check the SSL hostname, and fix pip's implementation of ssl_match_hostname to either use the python-backports-ssl-match_hostname package or to not be vulnerable to CVE-2013-2099: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=963260#c14\n\nLet me know what is decided here so that I can advise the python-virtualenv maintainer what to do for these vulnerabilities and issues in the python-virtualenv epel5 package (which is bundling an this older, insecure version of pip)."
