That's what I get for answering bugmail before coffee.  :-(\n\nYou can test w/Fedora or EPEL's nodejs package by running:\nwget https://raw.github.com/v8/v8/3d45af8494ab85d312c4be77999155ed5c045048/test/mjsunit/regress/regress-crbug-319835.js\nwget https://raw.github.com/v8/v8/3d45af8494ab85d312c4be77999155ed5c045048/test/mjsunit/regress/regress-crbug-319860.js\nnode --allow_natives_syntax regress-crbug-319835.js\nnode --allow_natives_syntax regress-crbug-319860.js\n\nThe first `node` call segfaults as expected with the vulnerability, while the second one does not with Fedora's v8 version.  I guess that isn't so strange given the question mark in the comments in the regression tests.  (I *really* wish Google would open their security bugs after CVEs go public.  Playing these guessing games is getting really old...)\n\nBackporting shouldn't be too difficult; will post a patch shortly."

That's what I get for answering bugmail before coffee.  :-(\n\nYou can test w/Fedora or EPEL's nodejs package by running:\nwget https://raw.github.com/v8/v8/3d45af8494ab85d312c4be77999155ed5c045048/test/mjsunit/regress/regress-crbug-319835.js\nwget https://raw.github.com/v8/v8/3d45af8494ab85d312c4be77999155ed5c045048/test/mjsunit/regress/regress-crbug-319860.js\nnode --allow_natives_syntax regress-crbug-319835.js\nnode --allow_natives_syntax regress-crbug-319860.js\n\nThe first `node` call segfaults as expected with the vulnerability, while the second one does not with Fedora's v8 version.  I guess that isn't so strange given the question mark in the comments in the regression tests.  (I *really* wish Google would open their security bugs after CVEs go public.  Playing these guessing games is getting really old...)\n\nBackporting shouldn't be too difficult; will post a patch shortly."
