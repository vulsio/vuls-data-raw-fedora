Yes, unfortunately, I don't have much time to look after the couchdb recently. On the other hand I don't see any BZ tickets opened so I wouldn't say that the package is stale/buggy.\n\nhttps://bugzilla.redhat.com/buglist.cgi?component=couchdb\n\nBtw are you interested in maintaining it? It will be great if you step in and continue building it in Fedora/EPEL.."

When 1.2.0 gets released (probably soon), they might drop the 1.0.x branch. I'm not 100% sure, but I believe they maintain the latest two minor version branches."
