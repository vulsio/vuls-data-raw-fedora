The packages were patched, see http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=457626:\n\n* Tue Aug 20 2013 Manuel \"lonely wolf\" Wolfshant <wolfy@fedoraproject.org> - 2.61-21\n- replace TLS patch with a corrected one. thanks Till Maas for the fix\n\nUnless you mean to say that your patch was also wrong?

Therefore ssmtp accepts any certificate signed by a trusted CA independent of the certificates common name or alternative names.\n\nMy patch only ensured that the code from the initial patch to verify certificates against a CA is really used."

The packages were patched, see http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=457626:\n\n* Tue Aug 20 2013 Manuel \"lonely wolf\" Wolfshant <wolfy@fedoraproject.org> - 2.61-21\n- replace TLS patch with a corrected one. thanks Till Maas for the fix\n\nUnless you mean to say that your patch was also wrong?

Therefore ssmtp accepts any certificate signed by a trusted CA independent of the certificates common name or alternative names.\n\nMy patch only ensured that the code from the initial patch to verify certificates against a CA is really used."
