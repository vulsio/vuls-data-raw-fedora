The vulnerability is\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is only exploitable on a server running a PHP version prior to 5.2 that does not have the json library installed.\r\n\r\nSecond issue is that the module uses Drupal's token scheme to restrict access to the json rendering of a block. This control mechanism is insufficient as Drupal's token scheme is designed to provide security between two different sessions (or a session and a non authenticated user) and is not designed to provide security within a session. The vulnerability is mitigated by needing blocks that have sensitive information.\r\n\r\nThe suggested fix is to update Drupal6-context to 6.x-3.2 and Drupal7-context to 7.x-3.0.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\nhttp://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2013/Oct/118\r\nhttps://drupal.org/node/2113317",
