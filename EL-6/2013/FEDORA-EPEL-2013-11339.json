If you \nwould still like  to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it \nagainst a later version  of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the \n'version' to a later Fedora version prior to Fedora 17's end of life.\n\nAlthough we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's \nlifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a \nmore recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes \nbugs or makes them obsolete."

A client could send a malformed Connection header to lighttpd (such as \"Connection: TE,,Keep-Alive\"), which would cause lighttpd to enter an endless loop, detecting an empty token but not incrementing the current string position, causing it to continually read ',' over and over.\r\n\r\nThis flaw was introduced in 1.4.31 [1] when an \"invalid read\" bug was fixed [2].\r\n\r\n[1] http://redmine.lighttpd.net/projects/lighttpd/repository/revisions/2830/diff/\r\n[2] http://redmine.lighttpd.net/issues/2413\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgement:\r\n\r\nRed Hat would like to thank Stefan BÃ¼hler for reporting this issue.
