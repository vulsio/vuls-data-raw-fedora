								"thetext": "The Redis command line tool \"redis-cli\" is vulnerable to a buffer overflow through the -h (host) command line parameter. If using redis-cli directly this could cause a self DoS or code execution with the same privilege level the command was executed with. This is unlikely to impact the security of the system as the attacker would already require access.\nIt is possible that products are built to call redis-cli and may allow an attacker with access to the layered product to gain command execution on the underlying system. This would require the unfiltered host parameter to be passed from the layered product to redis-cli\n\nSpecific to OpenStack:\nThe default key-value data store in OpenStack is memcached. Regardless, none of the components that are included with Red Hat OpenStack make calls to redis-cli in a way that would allow the host value to be manipulated."
