								"thetext": "Guess I should comment here instead of in one of the tracking bugs.\n\nBottom line is that this has been open upstream since May: https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=68298\n\nAs far as I can tell, upstream is completely unresponsive; there have been no comments to pretty much any of the bugs open on all of his packages on CPAN.\n\nSo far my searching hasn't turned up any patches from any other distro, but it's always possible that I'm missing something.  I'm not really up on the current state of cross-distro security collaboration so if anyone has any guidance, I'd be happy to hear it.\n\nPackages requiring this one:\nnetdisco\nperl-FusionInventory-Agent-Task-NetDiscovery\nperl-FusionInventory-Agent-Task-SNMPQuery\n\nHonestly at this point I'd really like to just drop it from the distro, but that may not be an option.  What remains is to fix it, but that doesn't appear trivial.\n\nThe module uses files in /tmp for communication between the master process and its children.  The children write out a file with a predictable name and the master knows where to look for data when a child exits.  You can't randomize the name because the predictability is important to how things work.\n\nThe master could pass a random name, in the environment or something, but that still gives an attacker plenty of time to get in there and predict the filename that will be used, create it, and do various \n\nThe master could pass an open file handle or something, but that changes the API.\n\nI wonder if it would be sufficient to create a random mode 700 directory in /tmp and just use that.  Honestly I'm no security expert and I certainly don't want to attempt a fix that doesn't actually help.  I've tried that before and found that the experts generally get rather derisive when you say you've fixed something but they can still find a problem with it."

								"thetext": "I gave this some look yesterday, and I can't see any nice way to fix this either.\n\nSafely creating temporary directory under /tmp would probably be the least invasive way to fix, but there's a problem with the clean-up at the end.  It seems it's valid to use this module in a way that parent process forks bunch of child processes, let them do their work and exit before they finish.  Hence this approach should leave a temporary directory behind on each run of such script.\n\nChanging child code to create the file safely does not seem like an option either.  If the predictable file name is used, attacker may \"DoS\" the child (create temp file so that child can not while its \"reply\" data structure).  Child can block (keep re-trying to create the file) or exit (let parent parse malicious file), but cases seem wrong.  As a side note, in current implementation, parent process tries to read the temp file even when the script is not written to use this data passing feature.  Hence attacker can easily make parent deserialize arbitrary malicious Storable blob.  Storable man page only mention it's unsafe when storing / retrieving of CODE is allowed (not by default), but still sounds like \"don't do this\".  Even if it's safe, that may have other side effects (block parent on read, make it use extra memory, trigger side effects when opening special files).\n\nParent process can create temp file safely, but can not use predictable file name with its current format, as it does not know child pid before fork.  Hence it'd need to use random name and have it stored in both parent and child data structs.  Of course, this has the same problem as temp dir idea in cases where parent exits before child.\n\nOne improvement can be to create temp file only when script wants to use structure passing (and hence parent is expected to wait for child), i.e. when on_finish callback is set.  However, even though docs say to declare callbacks before first start, it's apparent you can set them after start, as run_on_finish accepts optional pid argument to set child-specific callback.  I'm not sure what the intended semantic was, as setting callback after run is racy and the callback may not be run if child exits quickly.\n\nOne idea is to make new's tempdir parameter mandatory if script wants to use structure passing, and document that caller should provide a safe temporary directory (i.e. not /tmp) - such as directory that is not world writeable (/home/user/something or /var/lib/something), or safely created under /tmp.  Of course, that's something that we can't do without upstream.\n\nWe can downgrade module to the F14 version that lacks this new feature ;)."

It's only used for testing and isn't installed.\n\nTo my knowledge the current version of Parallel::ForkManager is compatible with the old version as long as you aren't using it in a way which was inherently insecure (relying on that predictably-named tempfile).
