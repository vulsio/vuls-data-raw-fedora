In Gluster, nrpe is installed as a dependency for gluster-nagios-addons, once all the nagios dependencies are removed from Gluster channel, nrpe will also be removed which is not maintained currently."

We evaluate master bug closure only based on commercial Red Hat products which are later populated on our CVE page. Community projects like Fedora and EPEL are not populated on CVE page. Hence, if none of our products(non-community) are affected we close the CVE as CLOSED:NOTABUG and status of community projects can be tracked separately on their individual tracker bugs as mentioned below.\n\n[1] https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1816804\n[2] https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1816805"
